      "[' The following is a conversation with Jürgen Schmidhuber', \" He's the co director of the CS Swiss AI Lab and a co creator of long short term memory networks\", ' LSDMs are used in billions of devices today for speech recognition, translation, and much more', ' Over 30 years, he has proposed a lot of interesting out of the box ideas on meta learning, adversarial networks, computer vision, and even a formal theory of quote, creativity, curiosity, and fun', ' This conversation is part of the MIT course on artificial general intelligence and the artificial intelligence podcast', ' If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, iTunes, or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman spelled F R I D', \" And now here's my conversation with Jürgen Schmidhuber\", ' Early on you dreamed of AI systems that self improve recursively', ' When was that dream born? When I was a baby', \" No, that's not true\", ' When I was a teenager', ' And what was the catalyst for that birth? What was the thing that first inspired you? When I was a boy, I was thinking about what to do in my life and then I thought the most exciting thing is to solve the riddles of the universe', ' And that means you have to become a physicist', \" However, then I realized that there's something even grander\", \" You can try to build a machine that isn't really a machine any longer that learns to become a much better physicist than I could ever hope to be\", \" And that's how I thought maybe I can multiply my tiny little bit of creativity into infinity\", ' But ultimately that creativity will be multiplied to understand the universe around us', \" That's the curiosity for that mystery that drove you\", ' Yes, so if you can build a machine that learns to solve more and more complex problems and more and more general problem solver then you basically have solved all the problems, at least all the solvable problems', \" So how do you think, what is the mechanism for that kind of general solver look like? Obviously we don't quite yet have one or know how to build one but we have ideas and you have had throughout your career several ideas about it\", ' So how do you think about that mechanism? So in the 80s, I thought about how to build this machine that learns to solve all these problems that I cannot solve myself', ' And I thought it is clear it has to be a machine that not only learns to solve this problem here and this problem here but it also has to learn to improve the learning algorithm itself', ' So it has to have the learning algorithm in a representation that allows it to inspect it and modify it such that it can come up with a better learning algorithm', ' So I call that meta learning, learning to learn and recursive self improvement that is really the pinnacle of that where you then not only learn how to improve on that problem and on that but you also improve the way the machine improves and you also improve the way it improves the way it improves itself', ' And that was my 1987 diploma thesis which was all about that higher education hierarchy of meta learners that have no computational limits except for the well known limits that Gödel identified in 1931 and for the limits of physics', ' In the recent years, meta learning has gained popularity in a specific kind of form', \" You've talked about how that's not really meta learning with neural networks, that's more basic transfer learning\", \" Can you talk about the difference between the big general meta learning and a more narrow sense of meta learning the way it's used today, the way it's talked about today? Let's take the example of a deep neural network that has learned to classify images and maybe you have trained that network on 100 different databases of images\", ' And now a new database comes along and you want to quickly learn the new thing as well', ' So one simple way of doing that is you take the network which already knows 100 types of databases and then you just take the top layer of that and you retrain that using the new label data that you have in the new image database', ' And then it turns out that it really, really quickly can learn that too, one shot basically because from the first 100 data sets, it already has learned so much about computer vision that it can reuse that and that is then almost good enough to solve the new task except you need a little bit of adjustment on the top', ' So that is transfer learning', ' And it has been done in principle for many decades', ' People have done similar things for decades', ' Meta learning too, meta learning is about having the learning algorithm itself open to introspection by the system that is using it and also open to modification such that the learning system has an opportunity to modify any part of the learning algorithm and then evaluate the consequences of that modification and then learn from that to create a better learning algorithm and so on recursively', \" So that's a very different animal where you are opening the space of possible learning algorithms to the learning system itself\", \" Right, so you've, like in the 2004 paper, you described gator machines, programs that rewrite themselves, right? Philosophically and even in your paper, mathematically, these are really compelling ideas but practically, do you see these self referential programs being successful in the near term to having an impact where sort of it demonstrates to the world that this direction is a good one to pursue in the near term? Yes, we had these two different types of fundamental research, how to build a universal problem solver, one basically exploiting proof search and things like that that you need to come up with asymptotically optimal, theoretically optimal self improvers and problem solvers\", ' However, one has to admit that through this proof search comes in an additive constant, an overhead, an additive overhead that vanishes in comparison to what you have to do to solve large problems', \" However, for many of the small problems that we want to solve in our everyday life, we cannot ignore this constant overhead and that's why we also have been doing other things, non universal things such as recurrent neural networks which are trained by gradient descent and local search techniques which aren't universal at all, which aren't provably optimal at all, like the other stuff that we did, but which are much more practical as long as we only want to solve the small problems that we are typically trying to solve in this environment here\", \" So the universal problem solvers like the Gödel machine, but also Markus Hutter's fastest way of solving all possible problems, which he developed around 2002 in my lab, they are associated with these constant overheads for proof search, which guarantees that the thing that you're doing is optimal\", \" For example, there is this fastest way of solving all problems with a computable solution, which is due to Markus, Markus Hutter, and to explain what's going on there, let's take traveling salesman problems\", ' With traveling salesman problems, you have a number of cities and cities and you try to find the shortest path through all these cities without visiting any city twice', \" And nobody knows the fastest way of solving traveling salesman problems, TSPs, but let's assume there is a method of solving them within N to the five operations where N is the number of cities\", \" Then the universal method of Markus is going to solve the same traveling salesman problem also within N to the five steps, plus O of one, plus a constant number of steps that you need for the proof searcher, which you need to show that this particular class of problems, the traveling salesman problems, can be solved within a certain time frame, solved within a certain time bound, within order N to the five steps, basically, and this additive constant doesn't care for N, which means as N is getting larger and larger, as you have more and more cities, the constant overhead pales in comparison, and that means that almost all large problems are solved in the best possible way\", ' Today, we already have a universal problem solver like that', \" However, it's not practical because the overhead, the constant overhead is so large that for the small kinds of problems that we want to solve in this little biosphere\", \" By the way, when you say small, you're talking about things that fall within the constraints of our computational systems\", \" So they can seem quite large to us mere humans, right? That's right, yeah\", ' So they seem large and even unsolvable in a practical sense today, but they are still small compared to almost all problems because almost all problems are large problems, which are much larger than any constant', \" Do you find it useful as a person who has dreamed of creating a general learning system, has worked on creating one, has done a lot of interesting ideas there, to think about P versus NP, this formalization of how hard problems are, how they scale, this kind of worst case analysis type of thinking, do you find that useful? Or is it only just a mathematical, it's a set of mathematical techniques to give you intuition about what's good and bad\", \" So P versus NP, that's super interesting from a theoretical point of view\", ' And in fact, as you are thinking about that problem, you can also get inspiration for better practical problem solvers', ' On the other hand, we have to admit that at the moment, the best practical problem solvers for all kinds of problems that we are now solving through what is called AI at the moment, they are not of the kind that is inspired by these questions', ' There we are using general purpose computers such as recurrent neural networks, but we have a search technique which is just local search gradient descent to try to find a program that is running on these recurrent networks, such that it can solve some interesting problems such as speech recognition or machine translation and something like that', ' And there is very little theory behind the best solutions that we have at the moment that can do that', \" Do you think that needs to change? Do you think that will change? Or can we go, can we create a general intelligent systems without ever really proving that that system is intelligent in some kind of mathematical way, solving machine translation perfectly or something like that, within some kind of syntactic definition of a language, or can we just be super impressed by the thing working extremely well and that's sufficient? There's an old saying, and I don't know who brought it up first, which says, there's nothing more practical than a good theory\", ' And a good theory of problem solving under limited resources, like here in this universe or on this little planet, has to take into account these limited resources', ' And so probably there is locking a theory, which is related to what we already have, these asymptotically optimal problem solvers, which tells us what we need in addition to that to come up with a practically optimal problem solver', ' So I believe we will have something like that', ' And maybe just a few little tiny twists are necessary to change what we already have, to come up with that as well', \" As long as we don't have that, we admit that we are taking suboptimal ways and recurrent neural networks and long short term memory for equipped with local search techniques\", \" And we are happy that it works better than any competing methods, but that doesn't mean that we think we are done\", \" You've said that an AGI system will ultimately be a simple one\", ' A general intelligence system will ultimately be a simple one', ' Maybe a pseudocode of a few lines will be able to describe it', ' Can you talk through your intuition behind this idea, why you feel that at its core, intelligence is a simple algorithm? Experience tells us that the stuff that works best is really simple', \" So the asymptotically optimal ways of solving problems, if you look at them, they're just a few lines of code, it's really true\", ' Although they are these amazing properties, just a few lines of code', \" Then the most promising and most useful practical things, maybe don't have this proof of optimality associated with them\", ' However, they are also just a few lines of code', ' The most successful recurrent neural networks, you can write them down in five lines of pseudocode', \" That's a beautiful, almost poetic idea, but what you're describing there is the lines of pseudocode are sitting on top of layers and layers of abstractions in a sense\", \" So you're saying at the very top, it'll be a beautifully written sort of algorithm\", \" But do you think that there's many layers of abstractions we have to first learn to construct? Yeah, of course, we are building on all these great abstractions that people have invented over the millennia, such as matrix multiplications and real numbers and basic arithmetics and calculus and derivations of error functions and derivatives of error functions and stuff like that\", \" So without that language that greatly simplifies our way of thinking about these problems, we couldn't do anything\", ' So in that sense, as always, we are standing on the shoulders of the giants who in the past simplified the problem of problem solving so much that now we have a chance to do the final step', ' So the final step will be a simple one', \" If we take a step back through all of human civilization and just the universe in general, how do you think about evolution and what if creating a universe is required to achieve this final step?

So it's all deterministic\", \" There's no randomness in our universe\", ' Does God play dice? So a couple of years ago, a famous physicist, quantum physicist, Anton Zeilinger, he wrote an essay in nature and it started more or less like that', ' One of the fundamental insights of the 20th century was that the universe is fundamentally random on the quantum level', ' And that whenever you measure spin up or down or something like that, a new bit of information enters the history of the universe', ' And while I was reading that, I was already typing the response and they had to publish it', ' Because I was right, that there is no evidence, no physical evidence for that', \" So there's an alternative explanation where everything that we consider random is actually pseudo random, such as the decimal expansion of pi, 3\", \"141 and so on, which looks random, but isn't\", ' So pi is interesting because every three digits sequence, every sequence of three digits appears roughly one in a thousand times', ' And every five digit sequence appears roughly one in 10,000 times, what you would expect if it was random', \" But there's a very short algorithm, a short program that computes all of that\", \" So it's extremely compressible\", \" And who knows, maybe tomorrow, somebody, some grad student at CERN goes back over all these data points, better decay and whatever, and figures out, oh, it's the second billion digits of pi or something like that\", \" We don't have any fundamental reason at the moment to believe that this is truly random and not just a deterministic video game\", ' If it was a deterministic video game, it would be much more beautiful', ' Because beauty is simplicity', ' And many of the basic laws of the universe, like gravity and the other basic forces are very simple', ' So very short programs can explain what these are doing', ' And it would be awful and ugly', ' The universe would be ugly', ' The history of the universe would be ugly if for the extra things, the random, the seemingly random data points that we get all the time, that we really need a huge number of extra bits to describe all these extra bits of information', \" So as long as we don't have evidence that there is no short program that computes the entire history of the entire universe, we are, as scientists, compelled to look further for that shortest program\", ' Your intuition says there exists a program that can backtrack to the creation of the universe', ' Yeah', ' So it can give the shortest path to the creation of the universe', ' Yes', ' Including all the entanglement things and all the spin up and down measures that have been taken place since 13', '8 billion years ago', \" So we don't have a proof that it is random\", \" We don't have a proof that it is compressible to a short program\", \" But as long as we don't have that proof, we are obliged as scientists to keep looking for that simple explanation\", ' Absolutely', ' So you said the simplicity is beautiful or beauty is simple', ' Either one works', ' But you also work on curiosity, discovery, the romantic notion of randomness, of serendipity, of being surprised by things that are about you', \" In our poetic notion of reality, we think it's kind of like, poetic notion of reality, we think as humans require randomness\", \" So you don't find randomness beautiful\", ' You find simple determinism beautiful', ' Yeah', ' Okay', ' So why? Why? Because the explanation becomes shorter', ' A universe that is compressible to a short program is much more elegant and much more beautiful than another one, which needs an almost infinite number of bits to be described', ' As far as we know, many things that are happening in this universe are really simple in terms of short programs that compute gravity and the interaction between elementary particles and so on', ' So all of that seems to be very, very simple', ' Every electron seems to reuse the same subprogram all the time, as it is interacting with other elementary particles', ' If we now require an extra oracle injecting new bits of information all the time for these extra things which are currently not understood, such as better decay, then the whole description length of the data that we can observe of the history of the universe would become much longer and therefore uglier', ' And uglier', ' Again, simplicity is elegant and beautiful', ' The history of science is a history of compression progress', \" Yes, so you've described sort of as we build up abstractions and you've talked about the idea of compression\", ' How do you see this, the history of science, the history of humanity, our civilization, and life on Earth as some kind of path towards greater and greater compression? What do you mean by that? How do you think about that? Indeed, the history of science is a history of compression progress', ' What does that mean? Hundreds of years ago there was an astronomer whose name was Kepler and he looked at the data points that he got by watching planets move', ' And then he had all these data points and suddenly it turned out that he can greatly compress the data by predicting it through an ellipse law', ' So it turns out that all these data points are more or less on ellipses around the sun', ' And another guy came along whose name was Newton and before him Hooke', ' And they said the same thing that is making these planets move like that is what makes the apples fall down', ' And it also holds for stones and for all kinds of other objects', ' And suddenly many, many of these observations became much more compressible because as long as you can predict the next thing, given what you have seen so far, you can compress it', \" And you don't have to store that data extra\", ' This is called predictive coding', ' And then there was still something wrong with that theory of the universe and you had deviations from these predictions of the theory', ' And 300 years later another guy came along whose name was Einstein', ' And he was able to explain away all these deviations from the predictions of the old theory through a new theory which was called the general theory of relativity', \" Which at first glance looks a little bit more complicated and you have to warp space and time but you can't phrase it within one single sentence which is no matter how fast you accelerate and how hard you decelerate and no matter what is the gravity in your local network, light speed always looks the same\", ' And from that you can calculate all the consequences', \" So it's a very simple thing and it allows you to further compress all the observations because certainly there are hardly any deviations any longer that you can measure from the predictions of this new theory\", ' So all of science is a history of compression progress', \" You never arrive immediately at the shortest explanation of the data but you're making progress\", ' Whenever you are making progress you have an insight', ' You see oh first I needed so many bits of information to describe the data, to describe my falling apples, my video of falling apples, I need so many data, so many pixels have to be stored', ' But then suddenly I realize no there is a very simple way of predicting the third frame in the video from the first two', ' And maybe not every little detail can be predicted but more or less most of these orange blobs that are coming down they accelerate in the same way which means that I can greatly compress the video', ' And the amount of compression, progress, that is the depth of the insight that you have at that moment', \" That's the fun that you have, the scientific fun, the fun in that discovery\", ' And we can build artificial systems that do the same thing', ' They measure the depth of their insights as they are looking at the data which is coming in through their own experiments and we give them a reward, an intrinsic reward in proportion to this depth of insight', \" And since they are trying to maximize the rewards they get they are suddenly motivated to come up with new action sequences, with new experiments that have the property that the data that is coming in as a consequence of these experiments has the property that they can learn something about, see a pattern in there which they hadn't seen yet before\", ' So there is an idea of power play that you described, a training in general problem solver in this kind of way of looking for the unsolved problems', ' Yeah', \" Can you describe that idea a little further? It's another very simple idea\", ' So normally what you do in computer science, you have some guy who gives you a problem and then there is a huge search space of potential solution candidates and you somehow try them out and you have more less sophisticated ways of moving around in that search space until you finally found a solution which you consider satisfactory', \" That's what most of computer science is about\", \" Power play just goes one little step further and says let's not only search for solutions to a given problem but let's search to pairs of problems and their solutions where the system itself has the opportunity to phrase its own problem\", ' So we are looking suddenly at pairs of problems and their solutions or modifications of the problem solver that is supposed to generate a solution to that new problem', ' And this additional degree of freedom allows us to build career systems that are like scientists in the sense that they not only try to solve and try to find answers to existing questions, no they are also free to pose their own questions', ' So if you want to build an artificial scientist you have to give it that freedom and power play is exactly doing that', \" So that's a dimension of freedom that's important to have but how hard do you think that, how multidimensional and difficult the space of then coming up with your own questions is\", \" So it's one of the things that as human beings we consider to be the thing that makes us special, the intelligence that makes us special is that brilliant insight that can create something totally new\", ' Yes', \" So now let's look at the extreme case, let's look at the set of all possible problems that you can formally describe which is infinite, which should be the next problem that a scientist or power play is going to solve\", ' Well, it should be the easiest problem that goes beyond what you already know', ' So it should be the simplest problem that the current problem solver that you have which can already solve 100 problems that he cannot solve yet by just generalizing', \" So it has to be new, so it has to require a modification of the problem solver such that the new problem solver can solve this new thing but the old problem solver cannot do it and in addition to that we have to make sure that the problem solver doesn't forget any of the previous solutions\", ' Right', ' And so by definition power play is now trying always to search in this pair of, in the set of pairs of problems and problems over modifications for a combination that minimize the time to achieve these criteria', \" So it's always trying to find the problem which is easiest to add to the repertoire\", ' So just like grad students and academics and researchers can spend their whole career in a local minima stuck trying to come up with interesting questions but ultimately doing very little', \" Do you think it's easy in this approach of looking for the simplest unsolvable problem to get stuck in a local minima? Is not never really discovering new, you know really jumping outside of the 100 problems that you've already solved in a genuine creative way?

Humans are curious and that means they behave like scientists, not only the official scientists but even the babies behave like scientists and they play around with their toys to figure out how the world works and how it is responding to their actions and that's how they learn about gravity and everything\", ' In 1990 we had the first systems like that which would just try to play around with the environment and come up with situations that go beyond what they knew at that time and then get a reward for creating these situations and then becoming more general problem solvers and being able to understand more of the world', \" I think in principle that curiosity strategy or more sophisticated versions of what I just described, they are what we have built in as well because evolution discovered that's a good way of exploring the unknown world and a guy who explores the unknown world has a higher chance of solving the mystery that he needs to survive in this world\", ' On the other hand, those guys who were too curious they were weeded out as well so you have to find this trade off', ' Evolution found a certain trade off', \" Apparently in our society there is a certain percentage of extremely explorative guys and it doesn't matter if they die because many of the others are more conservative\", \" It would be surprising to me if that principle of artificial curiosity wouldn't be present in almost exactly the same form here\", ' In our brains', ' You are a bit of a musician and an artist', \" Continuing on this topic of creativity, what do you think is the role of creativity and intelligence?

We never have a program, a sub program that is called creativity or something\", \" It's just a side effect of what our problem solvers do\", ' They are searching a space of problems, a space of candidates, of solution candidates until they hopefully find a solution to a given problem', ' But then there are these two types of creativity and both of them are now present in our machines', ' The first one has been around for a long time, which is human gives problem to machine, machine tries to find a solution to that', ' And this has been happening for many decades and for many decades machines have found creative solutions to interesting problems where humans were not aware of these particularly creative solutions but then appreciated that the machine found that', ' The second is the pure creativity', ' That I would call, what I just mentioned, I would call the applied creativity, like applied art where somebody tells you now make a nice picture of this Pope and you will get money for that', ' So here is the artist and he makes a convincing picture of the Pope and the Pope likes it and gives him the money', ' And then there is the pure creativity which is more like the power play and the artificial curiosity thing where you have the freedom to select your own problem', ' Like a scientist who defines his own question to study and so that is the pure creativity if you will as opposed to the applied creativity which serves another', ' And in that distinction there is almost echoes of narrow AI versus general AI', ' So this kind of constrained painting of a Pope seems like the approaches of what people are calling narrow AI and pure creativity seems to be, maybe I am just biased as a human but it seems to be an essential element of human level intelligence', ' Is that what you are implying? To a degree? If you zoom back a little bit and you just look at a general problem solving machine which is trying to solve arbitrary problems then this machine will figure out in the course of solving problems that it is good to be curious', \" So all of what I said just now about this prewired curiosity and this will to invent new problems that the system doesn't know how to solve yet should be just a byproduct of the general search\", ' However, apparently evolution has built it into us because it turned out to be so successful, a prewiring, a bias, a very successful exploratory bias that we are born with', ' And you have also said that consciousness in the same kind of way may be a byproduct of problem solving', ' Do you find this an interesting byproduct? Do you think it is a useful byproduct? What are your thoughts on consciousness in general?

We never have a procedure called consciousness in our machines', ' However, we get as side effects of what these machines are doing things that seem to be closely related to what people call consciousness', ' So for example, already in 1990 we had simple systems which were basically recurrent networks and therefore universal computers trying to map incoming data into actions that lead to success', ' Maximizing reward in a given environment, always finding the charging station in time whenever the battery is low and negative signals are coming from the battery, always find the charging station in time without bumping against painful obstacles on the way', ' So complicated things but very easily motivated', \" And then we give these little guys a separate recurrent neural network which is just predicting what's happening if I do that and that\", \" What will happen as a consequence of these actions that I'm executing\", \" And it's just trained on the long and long history of interactions with the world\", ' So it becomes a predictive model of the world basically', \" And therefore also a compressor of the observations of the world because whatever you can predict you don't have to store extra\", ' So compression is a side effect of prediction', \" And how does this recurrent network compress? Well, it's inventing little subprograms, little subnetworks that stand for everything that frequently appears in the environment like bottles and microphones and faces, maybe lots of faces in my environment so I'm learning to create something like a prototype face and a new face comes along and all I have to encode are the deviations from the prototype\", \" So it's compressing all the time the stuff that frequently appears\", \" There's one thing that appears all the time that is present all the time when the agent is interacting with its environment which is the agent itself\", ' But just for data compression reasons it is extremely natural for this recurrent network to come up with little subnetworks that stand for the properties of the agents, the hand, the other actuators and all the stuff that you need to better encode the data which is influenced by the actions of the agent', ' So there just as a side effect of data compression during problem solving you have internal self models', \" Now you can use this model of the world to plan your future and that's what we also have done since 1990\", \" So the recurrent network which is the controller which is trying to maximize reward can use this model of the network of the world, this model network of the world, this predictive model of the world to plan ahead and say let's not do this action sequence, let's do this action sequence instead because it leads to more predicted reward\", ' And whenever it is waking up these little subnetworks that stand for itself then it is thinking about itself and it is thinking about itself and it is exploring mentally the consequences of its own actions and now you tell me what is still missing', ' Missing the next, the gap to consciousness', \" There isn't\", \" That's a really beautiful idea that if life is a collection of data and life is a process of compressing that data to act efficiently in that data you yourself appear very often\", \" So it's useful to form compressions of yourself and it's a really beautiful formulation of what consciousness is a necessary side effect\", \" It's actually quite compelling to me\", \" You've described RNNs, developed LSTMs, long short term memory networks that are a type of recurrent neural networks that have gotten a lot of success recently\", \" So these are networks that model the temporal aspects in the data, temporal patterns in the data and you've called them the deepest of the neural networks\", ' So what do you think is the value of depth in the models that we use to learn? Since you mentioned the long short term memory and the LSTM I have to mention the names of the brilliant students who made that possible', ' First of all my first student ever Sepp Hochreiter who had fundamental insights already in his diploma thesis', ' Then Felix Geers who had additional important contributions', ' Alex Gray is a guy from Scotland who is mostly responsible for this CTC algorithm which is now often used to train the LSTM to do the speech recognition on all the Google Android phones and whatever and Siri and so on', ' So these guys without these guys I would be nothing', \" It's a lot of incredible work\", \" What is now the depth? What is the importance of depth?

I mean LSTM is one of the great examples of architectures that do something beyond just deeper and deeper networks', \" There's clever mechanisms for filtering data, for remembering and forgetting\", \" So do you think that kind of thinking is necessary? If you think about LSTMs as a leap, a big leap forward over traditional vanilla RNNs, what do you think is the next leap within this context?

We have this basic setup where you have one recurrent network which gets in the video and the speech and whatever and it's executing actions and it's trying to maximize reward so there is no teacher who tells it what to do at which point in time\", \" And then there's the other network which is just predicting what's going to happen if I do that and that and that could be an LSTM network and it learns to look back all the way to make better predictions of the next time step\", \" So essentially although it's predicting only the next time step it is motivated to learn to put into memory something that happened maybe a million steps ago because it's important to memorize that if you want to predict that at the next time step, the next event\", \" Now how can a model of the world like that, a predictive model of the world be used by the first guy?

The naive way we had about 30 years ago was let's just use the model of the world as a stand in, as a simulation of the world and millisecond by millisecond we plan the future and that means we have to roll it out really in detail and it will work only if the model is really good and it will still be inefficient because we have to look at all these possible futures and there are so many of them\", ' So instead what we do now since 2015 in our CM systems, controller model systems, we give the controller the opportunity to learn by itself how to use the potentially relevant parts of the M, of the model network to solve new problems more quickly', \" And if it wants to, it can learn to ignore the M and sometimes it's a good idea to ignore the M because it's really bad, it's a bad predictor in this particular situation of life where the controller is currently trying to maximize reward\", ' However, it can also learn to address and exploit some of the subprograms that came about in the model network through compressing the data by predicting it', ' So it now has an opportunity to reuse that code, the algorithmic information in the model network to reduce its own search space such that it can solve a new problem more quickly than without the model', ' Compression', \" So you're ultimately optimistic and excited about the power of RL, of reinforcement learning in the context of real systems\", ' Absolutely, yeah', ' So you see RL as a potential having a huge impact beyond just sort of the M part is often developed on supervised learning methods', ' You see RL as a for problems of self driving cars or any kind of applied cyber robotics', \" That's the correct interesting direction for research in your view? I do think so\", ' We have a company called Nasence which has applied reinforcement learning to little Audis which learn to park without a teacher', ' The same principles were used of course', ' So these little Audis, they are small, maybe like that, so much smaller than the real Audis', ' But they have all the sensors that you find in the real Audis', ' You find the cameras, the LIDAR sensors', ' They go up to 120 kilometers an hour if they want to', \" And they have pain sensors basically and they don't want to bump against obstacles and other Audis and so they must learn like little babies to park\", ' Take the raw vision input and translate that into actions that lead to successful parking behavior which is a rewarding thing', ' And yes, they learn that', \" So we have examples like that and it's only in the beginning\", ' This is just the tip of the iceberg and I believe the next wave of AI is going to be all about that', \" So at the moment, the current wave of AI is about passive pattern observation and prediction and that's what you have on your smartphone and what the major companies on the Pacific Rim are using to sell you ads to do marketing\", \" That's the current sort of profit in AI and that's only one or two percent of the world economy\", ' Which is big enough to make these companies pretty much the most valuable companies in the world', \" But there's a much, much bigger fraction of the economy going to be affected by the next wave which is really about machines that shape the data through their own actions\", \" Do you think simulation is ultimately the biggest way that those methods will be successful in the next 10, 20 years? We're not talking about 100 years from now\", \" We're talking about sort of the near term impact of RL\", ' Do you think really good simulation is required or is there other techniques like imitation learning, observing other humans operating in the real world?

So, which is why it's a super exciting game to tackle\", \" So it's on the order of chess, I would say, in terms of popularity, in terms of AI setting it as the bar of what is intelligence\", ' So in 2017, Labratus, how do you pronounce it? Labratus', ' Labratus', ' Labratus beats', ' A little Latin there', ' A little bit of Latin', ' Labratus beats a few, four expert human players', ' Can you describe that event?

Yeah, so you're exactly right\", \" So when you go from a game tree that's 10 to the 161, especially in an imperfect information game, it's way too large to solve directly, even with our fastest equilibrium finding algorithms\", ' So you wanna abstract it first', ' And abstraction in games is much trickier than abstraction in MDPs or other single agent settings', ' Because you have these abstraction pathologies that if I have a finer grained abstraction, the strategy that I can get from that for the real game might actually be worse than the strategy I can get from the coarse grained abstraction', ' So you have to be very careful', \" Now the kinds of abstractions, just to zoom out, we're talking about, there's the hands abstractions and then there's betting strategies\", ' Yeah, betting actions, yeah', ' Baiting actions', \" So there's information abstraction, don't talk about general games, information abstraction, which is the abstraction of what chance does\", ' And this would be the cards in the case of poker', \" And then there's action abstraction, which is abstracting the actions of the actual players, which would be bets in the case of poker\", ' Yourself and the other players? Yes, yourself and other players', ' And for information abstraction, we were completely automated', \" So these are algorithms, but they do what we call potential aware abstraction, where we don't just look at the value of the hand, but also how it might materialize into good or bad hands over time\", \" And it's a certain kind of bottom up process with integer programming there and clustering and various aspects, how do you build this abstraction? And then in the action abstraction, there it's largely based on how humans and other AIs have played this game in the past\", \" But in the beginning, we actually used an automated action abstraction technology, which is provably convergent that it finds the optimal combination of bet sizes, but it's not very scalable\", \" So we couldn't use it for the whole game, but we use it for the first couple of betting actions\", \" So what's more important, the strength of the hand, so the information abstraction or the how you play them, the actions, does it, you know, the romanticized notion again, is that it doesn't matter what hands you have, that the actions, the betting may be the way you win no matter what hands you have\", \" Yeah, so that's why you have to play a lot of hands so that the role of luck gets smaller\", \" So you could otherwise get lucky and get some good hands and then you're gonna win the match\", \" Even with thousands of hands, you can get lucky because there's so much variance in No Limit Texas Holden because if we both go all in, it's a huge stack of variance, so there are these massive swings in No Limit Texas Holden\", \" So that's why you have to play not just thousands, but over 100,000 hands to get statistical significance\", ' So let me ask another way this question', \" If you didn't even look at your hands, but they didn't know that, the opponents didn't know that, how well would you be able to do? Oh, that's a good question\", \" There's actually, I heard this story that there's this Norwegian female poker player called Annette Oberstad who's actually won a tournament by doing exactly that, but that would be extremely rare\", ' So you cannot really play well that way', ' Okay, so the hands do have some role to play, okay', ' So Labradus does not use, as far as I understand, they use learning methods, deep learning', \" Is there room for learning in, there's no reason why Labradus doesn't combine with an AlphaGo type approach for estimating the quality for function estimator\", \" What are your thoughts on this, maybe as compared to another algorithm which I'm not that familiar with, DeepStack, the engine that does use deep learning, that it's unclear how well it does, but nevertheless uses deep learning\", ' So what are your thoughts about learning methods to aid in the way that Labradus plays in the game of poker? Yeah, so as you said, Labradus did not use learning methods and played very well without them', ' Since then, we have actually, actually here, we have a couple of papers on things that do use learning techniques', ' Excellent', ' And deep learning in particular', \" And sort of the way you're talking about where it's learning an evaluation function, but in imperfect information games, unlike let's say in Go or now also in chess and shogi, it's not sufficient to learn an evaluation for a state because the value of an information set depends not only on the exact state, but it also depends on both players beliefs\", \" Like if I have a bad hand, I'm much better off if the opponent thinks I have a good hand and vice versa\", \" If I have a good hand, I'm much better off if the opponent believes I have a bad hand\", ' So the value of a state is not just a function of the cards', \" It depends on, if you will, the path of play, but only to the extent that it's captured in the belief distributions\", \" So that's why it's not as simple as it is in perfect information games\", \" And I don't wanna say it's simple there either\", \" It's of course very complicated computationally there too, but at least conceptually, it's very straightforward\", \" There's a state, there's an evaluation function\", ' You can try to learn it', ' Here, you have to do something more', \" And what we do is in one of these papers, we're looking at where we allow the opponent to actually take different strategies at the leaf of the search tree, if you will\", ' And that is a different way of doing it', \" And it doesn't assume therefore a particular way that the opponent plays, but it allows the opponent to choose from a set of different continuation strategies\", ' And that forces us to not be too optimistic in a look ahead search', \" And that's one way you can do sound look ahead search in imperfect information games, which is very difficult\", ' And you were asking about DeepStack', ' What they did, it was very different than what we do, either in Libratus or in this new work', ' They were randomly generating various situations in the game', ' Then they were doing the look ahead from there to the end of the game, as if that was the start of a different game', ' And then they were using deep learning to learn those values of those states, but the states were not just the physical states', ' They include belief distributions', \" When you talk about look ahead for DeepStack or with Libratus, does it mean, considering every possibility that the game can evolve, are we talking about extremely, sort of this exponentially growth of a tree? Yes, so we're talking about exactly that\", ' Much like you do in alpha beta search or Monte Carlo tree search, but with different techniques', \" So there's a different search algorithm\", ' And then we have to deal with the leaves differently', \" So if you think about what Libratus did, we didn't have to worry about this because we only did it at the end of the game\", ' So we would always terminate into a real situation and we would know what the payout is', \" It didn't do these depth limited lookaheads, but now in this new paper, which is called depth limited, I think it's called depth limited search for imperfect information games, we can actually do sound depth limited lookahead\", \" So we can actually start to do the look ahead from the beginning of the game on, because that's too complicated to do for this whole long game\", ' So in Libratus, we were just doing it for the end', \" So, and then the other side, this belief distribution, so is it explicitly modeled what kind of beliefs that the opponent might have? Yeah, it is explicitly modeled, but it's not assumed\", ' The beliefs are actually output, not input', ' Of course, the starting beliefs are input, but they just fall from the rules of the game because we know that the dealer deals uniformly from the deck, so I know that every pair of cards that you might have is equally likely', ' I know that for a fact, that just follows from the rules of the game', \" Of course, except the two cards that I have, I know you don't have those\", ' Yeah', ' You have to take that into account', \" That's called card removal and that's very important\", ' Is the dealing always coming from a single deck in Heads Up, so you can assume', \" Single deck, so you know that if I have the ace of spades, I know you don't have an ace of spades\", \" Great, so in the beginning, your belief is basically the fact that it's a fair dealing of hands, but how do you start to adjust that belief? Well, that's where this beauty of game theory comes\", ' So Nash equilibrium, which John Nash introduced in 1950, introduces what rational play is when you have more than one player', ' And these are pairs of strategies where strategies are contingency plans, one for each player', \" So that neither player wants to deviate to a different strategy, given that the other doesn't deviate\", ' But as a side effect, you get the beliefs from base roll', \" So Nash equilibrium really isn't just deriving in these imperfect information games, Nash equilibrium, it doesn't just define strategies\", ' It also defines beliefs for both of us and defines beliefs for each state', \" So at each state, it's called information sets\", \" At each information set in the game, there's a set of different states that we might be in, but I don't know which one we're in\", ' Nash equilibrium tells me exactly what is the probability distribution over those real world states in my mind', \" How does Nash equilibrium give you that distribution? So why? I'll do a simple example\", ' So you know the game Rock, Paper, Scissors? So we can draw it as player one moves first and then player two moves', \" But of course, it's important that player two doesn't know what player one moved, otherwise player two would win every time\", \" So we can draw that as an information set where player one makes one of three moves first, and then there's an information set for player two\", \" So player two doesn't know which of those nodes the world is in\", ' But once we know the strategy for player one, Nash equilibrium will say that you play 1 3rd Rock, 1 3rd Paper, 1 3rd Scissors', \" From that, I can derive my beliefs on the information set that they're 1 3rd, 1 3rd, 1 3rd\", ' So Bayes gives you that', ' Bayes gives you', \" But is that specific to a particular player, or is it something you quickly update with the specific player? No, the game theory isn't really player specific\", \" So that's also why we don't need any data\", \" We don't need any history how these particular humans played in the past or how any AI or human had played before\", \" It's all about rationality\", \" So the AI just thinks about what would a rational opponent do?

Yeah, so I think that overall, we're in a very different situation in game theory than we are in, let's say, machine learning\", \" So in machine learning, it's a fairly mature technology and it's very broadly applied and proven success in the real world\", ' In game solving, there are almost no applications yet', ' We have just become superhuman, which machine learning you could argue happened in the 90s, if not earlier, and at least on supervised learning, certain complex supervised learning applications', \" Now, I think the next challenge problem, I know you're not asking about it this way, you're asking about the technology breakthrough, but I think that big, big breakthrough is to be able to show that, hey, maybe most of, let's say, military planning or most of business strategy will actually be done strategically using computational game theory\", \" That's what I would like to see as the next five or 10 year goal\", ' Maybe you can explain to me again, forgive me if this is an obvious question, but machine learning methods, neural networks suffer from not being transparent, not being explainable', \" Game theoretic methods, Nash equilibria, do they generally, when you see the different solutions, are they, when you talk about military operations, are they, once you see the strategies, do they make sense, are they explainable, or do they suffer from the same problems as neural networks do? So that's a good question\", ' I would say a little bit yes and no', \" And what I mean by that is that these game theoretic strategies, let's say, Nash equilibrium, it has provable properties\", \" So it's unlike, let's say, deep learning where you kind of cross your fingers, hopefully it'll work\", \" And then after the fact, when you have the weights, you're still crossing your fingers, and I hope it will work\", ' Here, you know that the solution quality is there', \" There's provable solution quality guarantees\", \" Now, that doesn't necessarily mean that the strategies are human understandable\", \" That's a whole other problem\", ' So I think that deep learning and computational game theory are in the same boat in that sense, that both are difficult to understand', ' But at least the game theoretic techniques, they have these guarantees of solution quality', ' So do you see business operations, strategic operations, or even military in the future being at least the strong candidates being proposed by automated systems?

You know, Einstein was a hero to me, and I'm sure to many people, because he was able to make, of course, a major, major contribution to physics with simplifying a bit just a gedanken experiment, a thought experiment, you know, imagining communication with lights between a stationary observer and somebody on a train\", ' And I thought, you know, the fact that just with the force of his thought, of his thinking, of his mind, he could get to something so deep in terms of physical reality, how time depend on space and speed, it was something absolutely fascinating', ' It was the power of intelligence, the power of the mind', \" Do you think the ability to imagine, to visualize as he did, as a lot of great physicists do, do you think that's in all of us human beings? Or is there something special to that one particular human being? I think, you know, all of us can learn and have, in principle, similar breakthroughs\", ' There are lessons to be learned from Einstein', ' He was one of five PhD students at ETA, the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule in Zurich, in physics', ' And he was the worst of the five, the only one who did not get an academic position when he graduated, when he finished his PhD', ' And he went to work, as everybody knows, for the patent office', \" And so it's not so much that he worked for the patent office, but the fact that obviously he was smart, but he was not a top student, obviously was the anti conformist\", ' He was not thinking in the traditional way that probably his teachers and the other students were doing', ' So there is a lot to be said about trying to do the opposite or something quite different from what other people are doing', \" That's certainly true for the stock market\", \" Never buy if everybody's buying\", ' And also true for science', ' Yes', \" So you've also mentioned, staying on the theme of physics, that you were excited at a young age by the mysteries of the universe that physics could uncover\", ' Such, as I saw mentioned, the possibility of time travel', \" So the most out of the box question, I think I'll get to ask today, do you think time travel is possible? Well, it would be nice if it were possible right now\", ' In science, you never say no', ' But your understanding of the nature of time', ' Yeah', \" It's very likely that it's not possible to travel in time\", ' We may be able to travel forward in time if we can, for instance, freeze ourselves or go on some spacecraft traveling close to the speed of light', ' But in terms of actively traveling, for instance, back in time, I find probably very unlikely', ' So do you still hold the underlying dream of the engineering intelligence that will build systems that are able to do such huge leaps, like discovering the kind of mechanism that would be required to travel through time? Do you still hold that dream or echoes of it from your childhood? Yeah', \" I don't think whether there are certain problems that probably cannot be solved, depending what you believe about the physical reality, like maybe totally impossible to create energy from nothing or to travel back in time, but about making machines that can think as well as we do or better, or more likely, especially in the short and midterm, help us think better, which is, in a sense, is happening already with the computers we have\", ' And it will happen more and more', ' But that I certainly believe', \" And I don't see, in principle, why computers at some point could not become more intelligent than we are, although the word intelligence is a tricky one and one we should discuss\", ' What I mean with that', ' Intelligence, consciousness, words like love, all these need to be disentangled', \" So you've mentioned also that you believe the problem of intelligence is the greatest problem in science, greater than the origin of life and the origin of the universe\", \" You've also, in the talk I've listened to, said that you're open to arguments against you\", ' So what do you think is the most captivating aspect of this problem of understanding the nature of intelligence? Why does it captivate you as it does? Well, originally, I think one of the motivation that I had as, I guess, a teenager when I was infatuated with theory of relativity was really that I found that there was the problem of time and space and general relativity', ' But there were so many other problems of the same level of difficulty and importance that I could, even if I were Einstein, it was difficult to hope to solve all of them', \" So what about solving a problem whose solution allowed me to solve all the problems? And this was, what if we could find the key to an intelligence 10 times better or faster than Einstein? So that's sort of seeing artificial intelligence as a tool to expand our capabilities\", \" But is there just an inherent curiosity in you in just understanding what it is in here that makes it all work? Yes, absolutely, you're right\", ' So I started saying this was the motivation when I was a teenager', ' But soon after, I think the problem of human intelligence became a real focus of my science and my research because I think for me, the most interesting problem is really asking who we are', \" It's asking not only a question about science, but even about the very tool we are using to do science, which is our brain\", ' How does our brain work? From where does it come from? What are its limitations? Can we make it better? And that, in many ways, is the ultimate question that underlies this whole effort of science', \" So you've made significant contributions in both the science of intelligence and the engineering of intelligence\", ' In a hypothetical way, let me ask, how far do you think we can get in creating intelligence systems without understanding the biological, the understanding how the human brain creates intelligence? Put another way, do you think we can build a strong AI system without really getting at the core understanding the functional nature of the brain? Well, this is a real difficult question', ' We did solve problems like flying without really using too much our knowledge about how birds fly', ' It was important, I guess, to know that you could have things heavier than air being able to fly, like birds', ' But beyond that, probably we did not learn very much, some', ' The Brothers Wright did learn a lot of observation about birds and designing their aircraft', ' But you can argue we did not use much of biology in that particular case', \" Now, in the case of intelligence, I think that it's a bit of a bet right now\", \" If you ask, OK, we all agree we'll get at some point, maybe soon, maybe later, to a machine that is indistinguishable from my secretary, say, in terms of what I can ask the machine to do\", \" I think we'll get there\", \" And now the question is, you can ask people, do you think we'll get there without any knowledge about the human brain? Or that the best way to get there is to understand better the human brain? OK, this is, I think, an educated bet that different people with different backgrounds will decide in different ways\", ' The recent history of the progress in AI in the last, I would say, five years or 10 years has been that the main breakthroughs, the main recent breakthroughs, really start from neuroscience', ' I can mention reinforcement learning as one', \" It's one of the algorithms at the core of AlphaGo, which is the system that beat the kind of an official world champion of Go, Lee Sedol, two, three years ago in Seoul\", \" That's one\", ' And that started really with the work of Pavlov in 1900, Marvin Minsky in the 60s, and many other neuroscientists later on', ' And deep learning started, which is at the core, again, of AlphaGo and systems like autonomous driving systems for cars, like the systems that Mobileye, which is a company started by one of my ex postdocs, Amnon Shashua, did', ' So that is at the core of those things', ' And deep learning, really, the initial ideas in terms of the architecture of these layered hierarchical networks started with work of Torsten Wiesel and David Hubel at Harvard up the river in the 60s', ' So recent history suggests that neuroscience played a big role in these breakthroughs', ' My personal bet is that there is a good chance they continue to play a big role', ' Maybe not in all the future breakthroughs, but in some of them', ' At least in inspiration', ' At least in inspiration, absolutely, yes', ' So you studied both artificial and biological neural networks', ' You said these mechanisms that underlie deep learning and reinforcement learning', ' But there is nevertheless significant differences between biological and artificial neural networks as they stand now', ' So between the two, what do you find is the most interesting, mysterious, maybe even beautiful difference as it currently stands in our understanding? I must confess that until recently, I found that the artificial networks, too simplistic relative to real neural networks', \" But recently, I've been starting to think that, yes, there is a very big simplification of what you find in the brain\", ' But on the other hand, they are much closer in terms of the architecture to the brain than other models that we had, that computer science used as model of thinking, which were mathematical logics, LISP, Prologue, and those kind of things', \" So in comparison to those, they're much closer to the brain\", ' You have networks of neurons, which is what the brain is about', ' And the artificial neurons in the models, as I said, caricature of the biological neurons', \" But they're still neurons, single units communicating with other units, something that is absent in the traditional computer type models of mathematics, reasoning, and so on\", \" So what aspect would you like to see in artificial neural networks added over time as we try to figure out ways to improve them? So one of the main differences and problems in terms of deep learning today, and it's not only deep learning, and the brain, is the need for deep learning techniques to have a lot of labeled examples\", ' For instance, for ImageNet, you have like a training set, which is 1 million images, each one labeled by some human in terms of which object is there', \" And it's clear that in biology, a baby may be able to see millions of images in the first years of life, but will not have millions of labels given to him or her by parents or caretakers\", ' So how do you solve that? I think there is this interesting challenge that today, deep learning and related techniques are all about big data, big data meaning a lot of examples labeled by humans, whereas in nature, you have this big data is n going to infinity', \" That's the best, n meaning labeled data\", ' But I think the biological world is more n going to 1', ' A child can learn from a very small number of labeled examples', ' Like you tell a child, this is a car', \" You don't need to say, like in ImageNet, this is a car, this is a car, this is not a car, this is not a car, 1 million times\", ' And of course, with AlphaGo, or at least the AlphaZero variants, because the world of Go is so simplistic that you can actually learn by yourself through self play, you can play against each other', \" In the real world, the visual system that you've studied extensively is a lot more complicated than the game of Go\", \" On the comment about children, which are fascinatingly good at learning new stuff, how much of it do you think is hardware, and how much of it is software? Yeah, that's a good, deep question\", \" In a sense, it's the old question of nurture and nature, how much is in the gene, and how much is in the experience of an individual\", \" Obviously, it's both that play a role\", ' And I believe that the way evolution gives, puts prior information, so to speak, hardwired, is not really hardwired', \" But that's essentially an hypothesis\", \" I think what's going on is that evolution has almost necessarily, if you believe in Darwin, is very opportunistic\", ' And think about our DNA and the DNA of Drosophila', ' Our DNA does not have many more genes than Drosophila', ' The fly', ' The fly, the fruit fly', ' Now, we know that the fruit fly does not learn very much during its individual existence', \" It looks like one of these machinery that it's really mostly, not 100%, but 95%, hardcoded by the genes\", \" But since we don't have many more genes than Drosophila, evolution could encode in as a general learning machinery, and then had to give very weak priors\", ' Like, for instance, let me give a specific example, which is recent work by a member of our Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines', ' We know because of work of other people in our group and other groups, that there are cells in a part of our brain, neurons, that are tuned to faces', ' They seem to be involved in face recognition', ' Now, this face area seems to be present in young children and adults', \" And one question is, is there from the beginning? Is hardwired by evolution? Or somehow it's learned very quickly\", \" So what's your, by the way, a lot of the questions I'm asking, the answer is we don't really know\", \" But as a person who has contributed some profound ideas in these fields, you're a good person to guess at some of these\", \" So of course, there's a caveat before a lot of the stuff we talk about\", ' But what is your hunch? Is the face, the part of the brain that seems to be concentrated on face recognition, are you born with that? Or you just is designed to learn that quickly, like the face of the mother and so on? My hunch, my bias was the second one, learned very quickly', ' And it turns out that Marge Livingstone at Harvard has done some amazing experiments in which she raised baby monkeys, depriving them of faces during the first weeks of life', ' So they see technicians, but the technician have a mask', ' Yes', ' And so when they looked at the area in the brain of these monkeys that were usually defined faces, they found no face preference', ' So my guess is that what evolution does in this case is there is a plastic area, which is plastic, which is kind of predetermined to be imprinted very easily', ' But the command from the gene is not a detailed circuitry for a face template', ' Could be, but this will require probably a lot of bits', ' You had to specify a lot of connection of a lot of neurons', ' Instead, the command from the gene is something like imprint, memorize what you see most often in the first two weeks of life, especially in connection with food and maybe nipples', \" I don't know\", ' Well, source of food', ' And so that area is very plastic at first and then solidifies', \" It'd be interesting if a variant of that experiment would show a different kind of pattern associated with food than a face pattern, whether that could stick\", ' There are indications that during that experiment, what the monkeys saw quite often were the blue gloves of the technicians that were giving to the baby monkeys the milk', ' And some of the cells, instead of being face sensitive in that area, are hand sensitive', \" That's fascinating\", \" Can you talk about what are the different parts of the brain and, in your view, sort of loosely, and how do they contribute to intelligence? Do you see the brain as a bunch of different modules, and they together come in the human brain to create intelligence? Or is it all one mush of the same kind of fundamental architecture? Yeah, that's an important question\", ' And there was a phase in neuroscience back in the 1950 or so in which it was believed for a while that the brain was equipotential', ' This was the term', ' You could cut out a piece, and nothing special happened apart a little bit less performance', ' There was a surgeon, Lashley, who did a lot of experiments of this type with mice and rats and concluded that every part of the brain was essentially equivalent to any other one', \" It turns out that that's really not true\", ' There are very specific modules in the brain, as you said', ' And people may lose the ability to speak if you have a stroke in a certain region, or may lose control of their legs in another region', \" So they're very specific\", ' The brain is also quite flexible and redundant, so often it can correct things and take over functions from one part of the brain to the other', ' But really, there are specific modules', ' So the answer that we know from this old work, which was basically based on lesions, either on animals, or very often there was a mine of very interesting data coming from the war, from different types of injuries that soldiers had in the brain', ' And more recently, functional MRI, which allow you to check which part of the brain are active when you are doing different tasks, can replace some of this', ' You can see that certain parts of the brain are involved, are active in certain tasks', \" Vision, language, yeah, that's right\", \" But sort of taking a step back to that part of the brain that discovers that specializes in the face and how that might be learned, what's your intuition behind? Is it possible that from a physicist perspective, when you get lower and lower, that it's all the same stuff and it just, when you're born, it's plastic and quickly figures out this part is going to be about vision, this is going to be about language, this is about common sense reasoning\", \" Do you have an intuition that that kind of learning is going on really quickly, or is it really kind of solidified in hardware? That's a great question\", ' So there are parts of the brain like the cerebellum or the hippocampus that are quite different from each other', ' They clearly have different anatomy, different connectivity', ' Then there is the cortex, which is the most developed part of the brain in humans', ' And in the cortex, you have different regions of the cortex that are responsible for vision, for audition, for motor control, for language', ' Now, one of the big puzzles of this is that in the cortex is the cortex is the cortex', ' Looks like it is the same in terms of hardware, in terms of type of neurons and connectivity across these different modalities', ' So for the cortex, I think aside these other parts of the brain like spinal cord, hippocampus, cerebellum, and so on, for the cortex, I think your question about hardware and software and learning and so on, I think is rather open', ' And I find it very interesting for Risa to think about an architecture, computer architecture, that is good for vision and at the same time is good for language', ' Seems to be so different problem areas that you have to solve', ' But the underlying mechanism might be the same', \" And that's really instructive for artificial neural networks\", \" So we've done a lot of great work in vision, in human vision, computer vision\", ' And you mentioned the problem of human vision is really as difficult as the problem of general intelligence', ' And maybe that connects to the cortex discussion', \" Can you describe the human visual cortex and how the humans begin to understand the world through the raw sensory information? What's, for folks who are not familiar, especially on the computer vision side, we don't often actually take a step back except saying with a sentence or two that one is inspired by the other\", \" What is it that we know about the human visual cortex? That's interesting\", ' We know quite a bit', \" At the same time, we don't know a lot\", ' But the bit we know, in a sense, we know a lot of the details', \" And many we don't know\", ' And we know a lot of the top level, the answer to the top level question', \" But we don't know some basic ones, even in terms of general neuroscience, forgetting vision\", \" Why do we sleep?

So I think in the case of computers, because they were made by engineers, by us, this different level of understanding are rather separate on purpose\", ' They are separate modules so that the engineer that designed the circuit for the chips does not need to know what is inside PowerPoint', ' And somebody can write the software translating from one to the other', \" So in that case, I don't think understanding the transistor helps you understand PowerPoint, or very little\", ' If you want to understand the computer, this question, I would say you have to understand it at different levels', ' If you really want to build one, right?

Yeah, and I just saw that picture you had hidden over there, so I'm a little bit a little bit worried about that now\", ' Yeah, so in high school in Kansas City, you joined Shawnee Mission North high school robotics team', ' Yeah', \" Now that wasn't your high school\", \" That's right, that was that was the only high school in the area that had a like a teacher who was willing to sponsor our first robotics team\", ' I was gonna troll you a little bit', ' Jog your memory a little bit', ' Yeah, I was trying to look super cool and intense, because you know this was BattleBots', ' This is serious business', \" So we're standing there with a welded steel frame and looking tough\", ' So go back there', \" What is that drew you to robotics? Well, I think I've been trying to figure this out for a while, but I've always liked building things with Legos\", ' And when I was really, really young, I wanted the Legos that had motors and other things', ' And then, you know, Lego Mindstorms came out, and for the first time you could program Lego contraptions', ' And I think things just sort of snowballed from that', ' But I remember seeing, you know, the BattleBots TV show on Comedy Central and thinking that is the coolest thing in the world', ' I want to be a part of that', ' And not knowing a whole lot about how to build these 200 pound fighting robots', ' So I sort of obsessively poured over the internet forums where all the creators for BattleBots would sort of hang out and talk about, you know, document their build progress and everything', ' And I think I read, I must have read like, you know, tens of thousands of forum posts from basically everything that was out there on what these people were doing', ' And eventually like sort of triangulated how to put some of these things together', ' And I ended up doing BattleBots, which was, you know, I was like 13 or 14, which was pretty awesome', \" I'm not sure if the show is still running, but so BattleBots is, there's not an artificial intelligence component\", \" It's remotely controlled\", \" And it's almost like a mechanical engineering challenge of building things that can be broken\", \" They're radio controlled\", ' So, and I think that they allowed some limited form of autonomy', \" But, you know, in a two minute match, you're, in the way these things ran, you're really doing yourself a disservice by trying to automate it versus just, you know, do the practical thing, which is drive it yourself\", \" And there's an entertainment aspect, just going on YouTube, there's like an, some of them wield an axe, some of them, I mean, there's that fun\", ' So what drew you to that aspect? Was it the mechanical engineering? Was it the dream to create like Frankenstein and sentient being? Or was it just like the Lego, you like tinkering with stuff? I mean, that was just building something', ' I think the idea of, you know, this radio controlled machine that can do various things, if it has like a weapon or something was pretty interesting', \" I agree it doesn't have the same appeal as, you know, autonomous robots, which I, which I, you know, sort of gravitated towards later on\", ' But it was definitely an engineering challenge because everything you did in that competition was pushing components to their limits', \" So we would buy like these $40 DC motors that came out of a winch, like on the front of a pickup truck or something, and we'd power the car with those and we'd run them at like double or triple their rated voltage\", ' So they immediately start overheating, but for that two minute match you can get, you know, a significant increase in the power output of those motors before they burn out', \" And so you're doing the same thing for your battery packs, all the materials in the system\", \" And I think there's something, something intrinsically interesting about just seeing like where things break\", \" And did you offline see where they break? Did you take it to the testing point? Like how did you know two minutes? Or was there a reckless let's just go with it and see? We weren't very good at BattleBots\", ' We lost all of our matches the first round', \" The one I built first, both of them were these wedge shaped robots because wedge, even though it's sort of boring to look at, is extremely effective\", ' You drive towards another robot and the front edge of it gets under them and then they sort of flip over, kind of like a door stopper', ' And the first one had a pneumatic polished stainless steel spike on the front that would shoot out about eight inches', ' The purpose of which is what? Pretty, pretty ineffective actually, but it looks cool', ' And was it to help with the lift? No, it was, it was just to try to poke holes in the other robot', ' And then the second time I did it, which is the following, I think maybe 18 months later, we had a, well a titanium axe with a, with a hardened steel tip on it that was powered by a hydraulic cylinder which we were activating with liquid CO2, which was, had its own set of problems', \" So great, so that's kind of on the hardware side\", ' I mean at a certain point there must have been born a fascination on the software side', \" So what was the first piece of code you've written? Go back there, see what language was it? What, what was that? Was it Emacs? Vim? Was it a more respectable modern IDE? Do you, do you remember any of this? Yeah, well I remember, I think maybe when I was in third or fourth grade, the school I was at, elementary school, had a bunch of Apple II computers and we'd play games on those\", \" And I remember every once in a while something would, would, would crash or wouldn't start up correctly and it would dump you out to what I later learned was like sort of a command prompt\", ' And my teacher would come over and type, I actually remember this to this day for some reason, like PR number six or PR pound six, which is peripheral six, which is the disk drive, which would fire up the disk and load the program', \" And I just remember thinking wow, she's like a hacker, like teach me these, these codes, these error codes, that is what I called them at the time\", \" But she had no interest in that, so it wasn't until I think about fifth grade that I had a school where you could actually go on these Apple IIs and learn to program\", ' And so it was all in basic, you know, where every line, you know, the line numbers are all number, that every line is numbered and you have to like leave enough space between the numbers so that if you want to tweak your code you go back and the first line was 10 and the second line is 20', \" Now you have to go back and insert 15 and if you need to add code in front of that, you know, 11 or 12 and you hope you don't run out of line numbers and have to redo the whole thing\", \" And there's go to statements? Yeah, go to and it's very basic, maybe hence the name, but a lot of fun\", \" And that was like, that was, you know, that's when, you know, when you first program you see the magic of it\", \" It's like, it just, just like this world opens up with, you know, endless possibilities for the things you could build or or accomplish with that computer\", ' So you got the bug then, so even starting with basic and then what C++ throughout, what did you, was there computer programming, computer science classes in high school? Not, not where I went, so it was self taught, but I did a lot of programming', \" The thing that, you know, sort of pushed me in the path of eventually working on self driving cars is actually one of these really long trips driving from my house in Kansas to, to I think Las Vegas where we did the BattleBots competition and I had just gotten my, I think my learner's permit or early driver's permit and so I was driving this, you know, 10 hour stretch across western Kansas where it's just, you're going straight on a highway and it is mind numbingly boring\", \" And I remember thinking even then with my sort of mediocre programming background that this is something that a computer can do, right? Let's take a picture of the road, let's find the yellow lane markers and, you know, steer the wheel\", \" And, you know, later I'd come to realize this had been done, you know, since, since the 80s or the 70s or even earlier, but I still wanted to do it and sort of immediately after that trip switched from sort of BattleBots, which is more radio controlled machines, to thinking about building, you know, autonomous vehicles of some scale\", \" Start off with really small electric ones and then, you know, progress to what we're doing now\", \" So what was your view of artificial intelligence at that point? What did you think? So this is before, there's been waves in artificial intelligence, right? The current wave with deep learning makes people believe that you can solve in a really rich deep way the computer vision perception problem, but like in before the deep learning craze, you know, how do you think about, how would you even go about building a thing that perceives itself in the world, localizes itself in the world, moves around the world? Like when you were younger, I mean, what was your thinking about it? Well, prior to deep neural networks or convolutional neural analysis, these modern techniques we have, or at least ones that are in use today, it was all a heuristic space and so like old school image processing and I think extracting, you know, yellow lane markers out of an image of a road is one of the problems that lends itself reasonably well to those heuristic based methods, you know, like just do a threshold on the color yellow and then try to fit some lines to that using a Huff transform or something and then go from there\", ' Traffic light detection and stop sign detection, red, yellow, green', \" And I think you could, I mean, if you wanted to do a full, I was just trying to make something that would stay in between the lanes on a highway, but if you wanted to do the full, the full, you know, set of capabilities needed for a driverless car, I think you could, and we'd done this at cruise, you know, in the very first days, you can start off with a really simple, you know, human written heuristic just to get the scaffolding in place for your system\", ' Traffic light detection, probably a really simple, you know, color thresholding on day one just to get the system up and running before you migrate to, you know, a deep learning based technique or something else', ' And, you know, back in when I was doing this, my first one, it was on a Pentium 203, 233 megahertz computer in it and I think I wrote the first version in basic, which is like an interpreted language', \" It's extremely slow because that's the thing I knew at the time\", ' And so there was no, no chance at all of using, there was no, no computational power to do any sort of reasonable deep nets like you have today', \" So I don't know what kids these days are doing\", ' Are kids these days, you know, at age 13 using neural networks in their garage? I mean, that would be awesome', \" I get emails all the time from, you know, like 11, 12 year olds saying I'm having, you know, I'm trying to follow this TensorFlow tutorial and I'm having this problem\", ' And the general approach in the deep learning community is of extreme optimism of, as opposed to, you mentioned like heuristics, you can, you can, you can separate the autonomous driving problem into modules and try to solve it sort of rigorously, or you can just do it end to end', ' And most people just kind of love the idea that, you know, us humans do it end to end', ' We just perceive and act', \" We should be able to use that, do the same kind of thing when you're on nets\", \" And that, that kind of thinking, you don't want to criticize that kind of thinking because eventually they will be right\", ' Yeah', \" And so it's exciting and especially when they're younger to explore that as a really exciting approach\", \" But yeah, it's, it's changed the, the language, the kind of stuff you're tinkering with\", \" It's kind of exciting to see when these teenagers grow up\", ' Yeah', \" I can only imagine if you, if your starting point is, you know, Python and TensorFlow at age 13 where you end up, you know, after 10 or 15 years of that, that's, that's pretty cool\", ' Because of GitHub, because the state tools for solving most of the major problems in artificial intelligence are within a few lines of code for most kids', \" And that's incredible to think about also on the entrepreneurial side\", \" And, and on that point, was there any thought about entrepreneurship before you came to college? Is sort of doing, you're building this into a thing that impacts the world on a large scale? Yeah\", \" I've always wanted to start a company\", \" I think that's, you know, just a cool concept of creating something and exchanging it for value or creating value, I guess\", ' So in high school, I was, I was trying to build like, you know, servo motor drivers, little circuit boards and sell them online or other, other things like that', \" And certainly knew at some point I wanted to do a startup, but it wasn't really, I'd say until college, until I felt like I had the, I guess the right combination of the environment, the smart people around you and some free time and a lot of free time at MIT\", ' So you came to MIT as an undergrad 2004', \" That's right\", \" And that's when the first DARPA Grand Challenge was happening\", ' Yeah', ' The, the timing of that is beautifully poetic', \" So how did you get yourself involved in that one? Originally there wasn't a official entry\", ' Yeah, faculty sponsored thing', ' And so a bunch of undergrads, myself included, started meeting and got together and tried to haggle together some sponsorships', ' We got a vehicle donated, a bunch of sensors and tried to put something together', ' And so we had, our team was probably mostly freshmen and sophomores, you know, which, which was not really a fair, fair fight against maybe the, you know, postdoc and faculty led teams from other schools', ' But we, we got something up and running', ' We had our vehicle drive by wire and you know, very, very basic control and things', ' But on the day of the qualifying, sort of pre qualifying round, the one and only steering motor that we had purchased, the thing that we had retrofitted to turn the steering wheel on the truck died', \" And so our vehicle was just dead in the water, couldn't steer\", \" So we didn't make it very far\", ' On the hardware side', ' So was there a software component? Was there, like, how did your view of autonomous vehicles in terms of artificial intelligence evolve in this moment? I mean, you know, like you said from the 80s has been autonomous vehicles, but really that was the birth of the modern wave', \" The, the thing that captivated everyone's imagination that we can actually do this\", \" So what, how were you captivated in that way? So how did your view of autonomous vehicles change at that point? I'd say at that point in time it was, it was a curiosity as in, like, is this really possible? And I think that was generally the spirit and the purpose of that original DARPA Grand Challenge, which was to just get a whole bunch of really brilliant people exploring the space and pushing the limits\", \" And I think, like, to this day that DARPA Challenge with its, you know, million dollar prize pool was probably one of the most effective, you know, uses of taxpayer money dollar for dollar that I've seen, you know, because that, that small sort of initiative that DARPA put, put out sort of, in my view, was the catalyst or the tipping point for this, this whole next wave of autonomous vehicle development\", ' So that was pretty cool', ' So let me jump around a little bit on that point', \" They also did the Urban Challenge where it was in the city, but it was very artificial and there's no pedestrians and there's very little human involvement except a few professional drivers\", ' Yeah', \" Do you think there's room, and then there was the Robotics Challenge with humanoid robots\", ' Right', \" So in your now role is looking at this, you're trying to solve one of the, you know, autonomous driving, one of the harder, more difficult places in San Francisco\", \" Is there a role for DARPA to step in to also kind of help out, like, challenge with new ideas, specifically pedestrians and so on, all these kinds of interesting things? Well, I haven't, I haven't thought about it from that perspective\", \" Is there anything DARPA could do today to further accelerate things? And I would say, my instinct is that that's maybe not the highest and best use of their resources and time, because, like, kick starting and spinning up the flywheel is, I think, what what they did in this case for very, very little money\", ' But today this has become, this has become, like, commercially interesting to very large companies and the amount of money going into it and the amount of people, like, going through your class and learning about these things and developing these skills is just, you know, orders of magnitude more than it was back then', \" And so there's enough momentum and inertia and energy and investment dollars into this space right now that I don't, I don't, I think they're, I think they're, they can just say mission accomplished and move on to the next area of technology that needs help\", ' So then stepping back to MIT, you left MIT during your junior year', \" What was that decision like? As I said, I always wanted to do a company in, or start a company, and this opportunity landed in my lap, which was a couple guys from Yale were starting a new company, and I googled them and found that they had started a company previously and sold it actually on eBay for about a quarter million bucks, which was a pretty interesting story, but so I thought to myself, these guys are, you know, rock star entrepreneurs, they've done this before, they must be driving around in Ferraris because they sold their company, and, you know, I thought I could learn a lot from them, so I teamed up with those guys and, you know, went out during, went out to California during IAP, which is MIT's month off, on a one way ticket and basically never went back\", ' We were having so much fun, we felt like we were building something and creating something, and it was going to be interesting that, you know, I was just all in and got completely hooked, and that that business was Justin TV, which is originally a reality show about a guy named Justin, which morphed into a live video streaming platform, which then morphed into what is Twitch today, so that was, that was quite an unexpected journey', ' So no regrets? No', ' Looking back, it was just an obvious, I mean, one way ticket', \" I mean, if we just pause on that for a second, there was no, how did you know these are the right guys, this is the right decision, you didn't think it was just follow the heart kind of thing? Well, I didn't know, but, you know, just trying something for a month during IAP seems pretty low risk, right? And then, you know, well, maybe I'll take a semester off, MIT's pretty flexible about that, you can always go back, right? And then after two or three cycles of that, I eventually threw in the towel, but, you know, I think it's, I guess in that case I felt like I could always hit the undo button if I had to\", ' Right', ' But nevertheless, from when you look in retrospect, I mean, it seems like a brave decision, you know, it would be difficult for a lot of people to make', \" It wasn't as popular, I'd say that the general, you know, flux of people out of MIT at the time was mostly into, you know, finance or consulting jobs in Boston or New York, and very few people were going to California to start companies, but today I'd say that's, it's probably inverted, which is just a sign of, a sign of the times, I guess\", ' Yeah', \" So there's a story about midnight of March 18, 2007, where TechCrunch, I guess, announced Justin\", 'TV earlier than it was supposed to, a few hours', \" The site didn't work\", \" I don't know if any of this is true, you can tell me\", ' And you and one of the folks at Justin', 'TV, Emmett Shearer, coded through the night', ' Can you take me through that experience? So let me, let me say a few nice things that, the article I read quoted Justin Kahn said that you were known for bureau coding through problems and being a creative, quote, creative genius', \" So on that night, what, what was going through your head, or maybe I'd put another way, how do you solve these problems? What's your approach to solving these kinds of problems where the line between success and failure seems to be pretty thin? That's a good question\", \" Well, first of all, that's, that's a nice of Justin to say that\", \" I think, you know, I would have been maybe 21 years old then and not very experienced at programming, but as with, with everything in a startup, you're sort of racing against the clock\", ' And so our plan was the second we had this live streaming camera backpack up and running, where Justin could wear it and no matter where he went in a city, it would be streaming live video', ' And this is even before the iPhones', ' This is like hard to do back then', ' We would launch', ' And so we thought we were there and the backpack was working and then we sent out all the emails to launch the, launch the company and do the press thing', \" And then, you know, we weren't quite actually there\", \" And then we thought, oh, well, you know, they're not going to announce it until maybe 10 a\", 'm', ' the next morning', \" And it's, I don't know, it's 5 p\", 'm', ' now', ' So how many hours do we have left? What is that? Like, you know, 17 hours to go', ' And, and that was, that was going to be fine', ' Was the problem obvious? Did you understand what could possibly, like, how complicated was the system at that point? It was, it was pretty messy', ' So to get a live video feed that looked decent working from anywhere in San Francisco, I put together this system where we had like three or four cell phone data modems and they were, like, we take the video stream and, you know, sort of spray it across these three or four modems and then try to catch all the packets on the other side, you know, with unreliable cell phone networks', \" It's pretty low level networking\", ' Yeah, and putting these, like, you know, sort of protocols on top of all that to, to reassemble and reorder the packets and have time buffers and error correction and all that kind of stuff', ' And the night before it was just staticky', ' Every once in a while the image would, would go to staticky and there would be this horrible, like, screeching audio noise because the audio was also corrupted', ' And this would happen, like, every five to ten minutes or so and it was a really, you know, off putting to the viewers', \" How do you tackle that problem? What was the, uh, you're just freaking out behind a computer\", \" There's, are there other, other folks working on this problem? Like, were you behind a whiteboard? Were you doing, uh, Yeah, it was a little, it was a little, yeah, it's a little lonely because there's four of us working on the company and only two people really wrote code\", ' And Emmett wrote the website and the chat system and I wrote the software for this video streaming device and video server', \" And so, you know, it's my sole responsibility to figure that out\", \" And I think, I think it's those, you know, setting, setting deadlines, trying to move quickly and everything where you're in that moment of intense pressure that sometimes people do their best and most interesting work\", \" And so even though that was a terrible moment, I look back on it fondly because that's like, you know, that's one of those character defining moments, I think\", ' So in 2013, October, you founded Cruise Automation', ' Yeah', ' So progressing forward, another exceptionally successful company was acquired by GM in 16 for $1 billion', ' But in October 2013, what was on your mind? What was the plan? How does one seriously start to tackle one of the hardest robotics, most important impact for robotics problems of our age? After going through Twitch, Twitch was, was, and is today, pretty successful', ' But the, the work was, the result was entertainment, mostly', ' Like, the better the product was, the more we would entertain people and then, you know, make money on the ad revenues and other things', ' And that was, that was a good thing', ' It felt, felt good to entertain people', ' But I figured like, you know, what is really the point of becoming a really good engineer and developing these skills other than, you know, my own enjoyment? And I realized I wanted something that scratched more of an existential itch, like something that, that truly matters', ' And so I basically made this list of requirements for a new, if I was going to do another company, and the one thing I knew in the back of my head that Twitch took like eight years to become successful', ' And so whatever I do, I better be willing to commit, you know, at least 10 years to something', ' And when you think about things from that perspective, you certainly, I think, raise the bar on what you choose to work on', \" So for me, the three things were it had to be something where the technology itself determines the success of the product, like hard, really juicy technology problems, because that's what motivates me\", ' And then it had to have a direct and positive impact on society in some way', \" So an example would be like, you know, health care, self driving cars, because they save lives, other things where there's a clear connection to somehow improving other people's lives\", \" And the last one is it had to be a big business, because for the positive impact to matter, it's got to be a large scale\", ' And I was thinking about that for a while, and I made like, I tried writing a Gmail clone and looked at some other ideas', ' And then it just sort of light bulb went off, like self driving cars, like that was the most fun I had ever had in college working on that', \" And like, well, what's the state of the technology? It's been 10 years\", ' Maybe times have changed, and maybe now is the time to make this work', ' And I poked around and looked at, the only other thing out there really at the time was the Google self driving car project', \" And I thought, surely there's a way to, you know, have an entrepreneur mindset and sort of solve the minimum viable product here\", ' And so I just took the plunge right then and there and said, this is something I know I can commit 10 years to', \" It's the probably the greatest applied AI problem of our generation\", \" And if it works, it's going to be both a huge business and therefore like, probably the most positive impact I can possibly have on the world\", ' So after that light bulb went off, I went all in on cruise immediately and got to work', ' Did you have an idea how to solve this problem? Which aspect of the problem to solve? You know, slow, like we just had Oliver from Voyage here, slow moving retirement communities, urban driving, highway driving', ' Did you have, like, did you have a vision of the city of the future where, you know, the transportation is largely automated, that kind of thing? Or was it sort of more fuzzy and gray area than that? My analysis of the situation is that Google is putting a lot, had been putting a lot of money into that project', ' They had a lot more resources', \" And so, and they still hadn't cracked the fully driverless car\", ' You know, this is 2013, I guess', ' So I thought, what can I do to sort of go from zero to, you know, significant scale so I can actually solve the real problem, which is the driverless cars', \" And I thought, here's the strategy\", \" We'll start by doing a really simple problem or solving a really simple problem that creates value for people\", \" So, eventually ended up deciding on automating highway driving, which is relatively more straightforward as long as there's a backup driver there\", \" And, you know, the go to market will be able to retrofit people's cars and just sell these products directly\", \" And the idea was, we'll take all the revenue and profits from that and use it to do the, so sort of reinvest that in research for doing fully driverless cars\", ' And that was the plan', ' The only thing that really changed along the way between then and now is we never really launched the first product', ' We had enough interest from investors and enough of a signal that this was something that we should be working on, that after about a year of working on the highway autopilot, we had it working, you know, on a prototype stage', \" But we just completely abandoned that and said, we're going to go all in on driverless cars now is the time\", \" Can't think of anything that's more exciting and if it works more impactful, so we're just going to go for it\", ' The idea of retrofit is kind of interesting', ' Yeah', \" Being able to, it's how you achieve scale\", \" It's a really interesting idea\", \" Is it something that's still in the in the back of your mind as a possibility? Not at all\", \" I've come full circle on that one\", \" After trying to build a retrofit product, and I'll touch on some of the complexities of that, and then also having been inside an OEM and seeing how things work and how a vehicle is developed and validated\", \" When it comes to something that has safety critical implications like controlling the steering and other control inputs on your car, it's pretty hard to get there with a retrofit\", ' Or if you did, even if you did, it creates a whole bunch of new complications around liability or how did you truly validate that', \" Or you know, something in the base vehicle fails and causes your system to fail, whose fault is it? Or if the car's anti lock brake systems or other things kick in or the software has been, it's different in one version of the car you retrofit versus another and you don't know because the manufacturer has updated it behind the scenes\", \" There's basically an infinite list of long tail issues that can get you\", \" And if you're dealing with a safety critical product, that's not really acceptable\", \" That's a really convincing summary of why that's really challenging\", \" But I didn't know all that at the time, so we tried it anyway\", \" But as a pitch also at the time, it's a really strong one\", \" Because that's how you achieve scale and that's how you beat the current, the leader at the time of Google or the only one in the market\", ' The other big problem we ran into, which is perhaps the biggest problem from a business model perspective, is we had kind of assumed that we started with an Audi S4 as the vehicle we retrofitted with this highway driving capability', \" And we had kind of assumed that if we just knock out like three make and models of vehicles, that'll cover like 80% of the San Francisco market\", \" Doesn't everyone there drive, I don't know, a BMW or a Honda Civic or one of these three cars? And then we surveyed our users and we found out that it's all over the place\", \" We would, to get even a decent number of units sold, we'd have to support like, you know, 20 or 50 different models\", ' And each one is a little butterfly that takes time and effort to maintain, you know, that retrofit integration and custom hardware and all this', ' So it was a tough business', ' So GM manufactures and sells over 9 million cars a year', ' And what you with Cruise are trying to do some of the most cutting edge innovation in terms of applying AI', \" And so how do those, you've talked about a little bit before, but it's also just fascinating to me\", \" We work a lot of automakers, you know, the difference between the gap between Detroit and Silicon Valley, let's say, just to be sort of poetic about it, I guess\", ' How do you close that gap? How do you take GM into the future where a large part of the fleet will be autonomous, perhaps? I want to start by acknowledging that GM is made up of, you know, tens of thousands of really brilliant, motivated people who want to be a part of the future', \" And so it's pretty fun to work within the attitude inside a car company like that is, you know, embracing this transformation and change rather than fearing it\", \" And I think that's a testament to the leadership at GM and that's flown all the way through to everyone you talk to, even the people in the assembly plants working on these cars\", \" So that's really great\", \" So starting from that position makes it a lot easier so then when the people in San Francisco at Cruise interact with the people at GM, at least we have this common set of values, which is that we really want this stuff to work because we think it's important and we think it's the future\", \" That's not to say, you know, those two cultures don't clash\", ' They absolutely do', \" There's different sort of value systems\", ' Like in a car company, the thing that gets you promoted and sort of the reward system is following the processes, delivering the program on time and on budget', \" So any sort of risk taking is discouraged in many ways because if a program is late or if you shut down the plant for a day, it's, you know, you can count the millions of dollars that burn by pretty quickly\", \" Whereas I think, you know, most Silicon Valley companies and in Cruise and the methodology we were employing, especially around the time of the acquisition, the reward structure is about trying to solve these complex problems in any way shape or form or coming up with crazy ideas that, you know, 90% of them won't work\", ' And so meshing that culture of sort of continuous improvement and experimentation with one where everything needs to be rigorously defined up front so that you never slip a deadline or miss a budget was a pretty big challenge', \" And that we're over three years in now after the acquisition and I'd say like, you know, the investment we made in figuring out how to work together successfully and who should do what and how we bridge the gaps between these very different systems and way of doing engineering work is now one of our greatest assets because I think we have this really powerful thing\", ' But for a while it was both GM and Cruise were very steep on the learning curve', \" Yeah, so I'm sure it was very stressful\", \" It's really important work because that's how to revolutionize the transportation, really to revolutionize any system\", ' You know, you look at the health care system or you look at the legal system', \" I have people like Loris come up to me all the time like everything they're working on can easily be automated\", \" But then that's not a good feeling\", \" Yeah, well it's not a good feeling but also there's no way to automate because the entire infrastructure is really, you know, based is older and it moves very slowly\", \" And so how do you close the gap between I have an how can I replace, of course, Loris don't want to be replaced with an app, but you could replace a lot of aspect when most of the data is still on paper\", ' And so the same thing was with automotive', \" I mean, it's fundamentally software\", \" It's basically hiring software engineers\", \" It's thinking in a software world\", \" I mean, I'm pretty sure nobody in Silicon Valley has ever hit a deadline\", ' So and then on GM', \" That's probably true, yeah\", ' And GM side is probably the opposite', ' Yeah', \" So that's that culture gap is really fascinating\", \" So you're optimistic about the future of that? Yeah, I mean, from what I've seen, it's impressive\", \" And I think like especially in Silicon Valley, it's easy to write off building cars because, you know, people have been doing that for over 100 years now in this country\", \" And so it seems like that's a solved problem, but that doesn't mean it's an easy problem\", \" And I think it would be easy to sort of overlook that and think that, you know, we're Silicon Valley engineers\", ' We can solve any problem, you know, building a car', \" It's been done\", \" Therefore, it's, you know, it's not a real engineering challenge\", \" But after having seen just the sheer scale and magnitude and industrialization that occurs inside of an automotive assembly plant, that is a lot of work that I am very glad that we don't have to reinvent to make self driving cars work\", \" And so to have, you know, partners who have done that for 100 years now, these great processes and this huge infrastructure and supply base that we can tap into is just remarkable because the scope and surface area of the problem of deploying fleets of self driving cars is so large that we're constantly looking for ways to do less so we can focus on the things that really matter more\", ' And if we had to figure out how to build and assemble and you know, build the cars themselves', ' I mean, we work closely with GM on that', ' But if we had to develop all that capability in house as well, you know, that would just make the problem really intractable, I think', \" So yeah, just like your first entry at the MIT DARPA challenge when there was what the motor that failed, somebody that knows what they're doing with the motor did it\", ' That would have been nice if we could focus on the software, not the hardware platform', ' Yeah', ' Right', \" So from your perspective now, you know, there's so many ways that autonomous vehicles can impact society in the next year, five years, ten years\", \" What do you think is the biggest opportunity to make money in autonomous driving, sort of make it a financially viable thing in the near term? What do you think will be the biggest impact there? Well, the things that drive the economics for fleets of self driving cars are, there's sort of a handful of variables\", ' One is, you know, the cost to build the vehicle itself', \" So the material cost, how many, you know, what's the cost of all your sensors plus the cost of the vehicle and every all the other components on it\", ' Another one is the lifetime of the vehicle', \" It's very different if your vehicle drives 100,000 miles and then it falls apart versus, you know, two million\", \" And then, you know, if you have a fleet, it's kind of like an airplane or an airline where once you produce the vehicle, you want it to be in operation as many hours a day as possible producing revenue\", \" And then, you know, the other piece of that is how are you generating revenue? I think that's kind of what you're asking\", \" And I think the obvious things today are, you know, the ride sharing business because that's pretty clear that there's demand for that, there's existing markets you can tap into and large urban areas, that kind of thing\", ' Yeah, yeah', ' And I think that there are some real benefits to having cars without drivers compared to sort of the status quo for people who use ride share services today', ' You know, you get privacy, consistency, hopefully significantly improve safety, all these benefits versus the current product', \" But it's a crowded market\", \" And then other opportunities, which you've seen a lot of activity in the last, really in the last six or twelve months, is, you know, delivery, whether that's parcels and packages, food or groceries\", \" Those are all sort of, I think, opportunities that are pretty ripe for these, you know, once you have this core technology, which is the fleet of autonomous vehicles, there's all sorts of different business opportunities you can build on top of that\", \" But I think the important thing, of course, is that there's zero monetization opportunity until you actually have that fleet of very capable driverless cars that are that are as good or better than humans\", \" And that's sort of where the entire industry is sort of in this holding pattern right now\", \" Yeah, they're trying to achieve that baseline\", ' So, but you said sort of not reliability, consistency', \" It's kind of interesting, I think I heard you say somewhere, I'm not sure if that's what you meant, but you know, I can imagine a situation where you would get an autonomous vehicle and, you know, when you get into an Uber or Lyft, you don't get to choose the driver in a sense that you don't get to choose the personality of the driving\", \" Do you think there's a, there's room to define the personality of the car the way it drives you in terms of aggressiveness, for example, in terms of sort of pushing the bound? One of the biggest challenges of autonomous driving is the is the trade off between sort of safety and assertiveness\", \" And do you think there's any room for the human to take a role in that decision? Sort of accept some of the liability, I guess\", \" I wouldn't, no, I'd say within reasonable bounds, as in we're not gonna, I think it'd be highly unlikely we'd expose any knob that would let you, you know, significantly increase safety risk\", \" I think that's just not something we'd be willing to do\", ' But I think driving style or like, you know, are you going to relax the comfort constraints slightly or things like that, all of those things make sense and are plausible', ' I see all those as, you know, nice optimizations', ' Once again, we get the core problem solved in these fleets out there', \" But the other thing we've sort of observed is that you have this intuition that if you sort of slam your foot on the gas right after the light turns green and aggressively accelerate, you're going to get there faster\", ' But the actual impact of doing that is pretty small', \" You feel like you're getting there faster, but so the same would be true for AVs\", \" Even if they don't slam their, you know, the pedal to the floor when the light turns green, they're going to get you there within, you know, if it's a 15 minute trip, within 30 seconds of what you would have done otherwise if you were going really aggressively\", \" So I think there's this sort of self deception that my aggressive driving style is getting me there faster\", \" Well, so that's, you know, some of the things I've studied, some of the things I'm fascinated by the psychology of that\", \" I don't think it matters that it doesn't get you there faster\", \" It's the emotional release\", \" Driving is a place, being inside of a car, somebody said it's like the real world version of being a troll\", \" So you have this protection, this mental protection, you're able to sort of yell at the world, like release your anger, whatever\", \" So there's an element of that that I think autonomous vehicles would also have to, you know, giving an outlet to people, but it doesn't have to be through, through, through driving or honking or so on\", \" There might be other outlets, but I think to just sort of even just put that aside, the baseline is really, you know, that's the focus\", \" That's the thing you need to solve\", ' And then the fun human things can be solved after', \" But so from the baseline of just solving autonomous driving, you're working in San Francisco, one of the more difficult cities to operate in\", \" What is, what is the, in your view, currently the hardest aspect of autonomous driving? Is it negotiating with pedestrians? Is it edge cases of perception? Is it planning? Is there a mechanical engineering? Is it data, fleet stuff? What are your thoughts on the challenge, the more challenging aspects there? That's a, that's a good question\", \" I think before, before we go to that, though, I just want to, I like what you said about the psychology aspect of this, because I think one observation I've made is I think I read somewhere that I think it's maybe Americans on average spend, you know, over an hour a day on social media, like staring at Facebook\", \" And so that's just, you know, 60 minutes of your life, you're not getting back\", \" It's probably not super productive\", \" And so that's 3,600 seconds, right? And that's, that's time, you know, it's a lot of time you're giving up\", \" And if you compare that to people being on the road, if another vehicle, whether it's a human driver or autonomous vehicle, delays them by even three seconds, they're laying in on the horn, you know, even though that's, that's, you know, one, one thousandth of the time they waste looking at Facebook every day\", \" So there's, there's definitely some\", ' You know, psychology aspects of this, I think that are pretty interesting road rage in general', \" And then the question of course is if everyone is in self driving cars, do they even notice these three second delays anymore? Cause they're doing other things or reading or working or just talking to each other\", \" So it'll be interesting to see where that goes\", ' In a certain aspect, people, people need to be distracted by something entertaining, something useful inside the car', \" So they don't pay attention to the external world\", ' And then, and then they can take whatever psychology and bring it back to Twitter and then focus on that as opposed to sort of interacting, sort of putting the emotion out there into the world', \" So it's a, it's an interesting problem, but baseline autonomy\", ' I guess you could say self driving cars, you know, at scale will lower the collective blood pressure of society probably by a couple of points without all that road rage and stress', \" So that's a good, good external\", ' So back to your question about the technology and the, I guess the biggest problems', \" And I have a hard time answering that question because, you know, we've been at this like specifically focusing on driverless cars and all the technology needed to enable that for a little over four and a half years now\", ' And even a year or two in, I felt like we had completed the functionality needed to get someone from point A to point B', ' As in, if we need to do a left turn maneuver, or if we need to drive around at, you know, a double parked vehicle into oncoming traffic or navigate through construction zones, the scaffolding and the building blocks was there pretty early on', ' And so the challenge is not any one scenario or situation for which, you know, we fail at 100% of those', \" It's more, you know, we're benchmarking against a pretty good or pretty high standard, which is human driving\", ' All things considered, humans are excellent at handling edge cases and unexpected scenarios where computers are the opposite', ' And so beating that baseline set by humans is the challenge', \" And so what we've been doing for quite some time now is basically, it's this continuous improvement process where we find sort of the most, you know, uncomfortable or the things that could lead to a safety issue or other things, all these events\", ' And then we sort of categorize them and rework parts of our system to make incremental improvements and do that over and over and over again', ' And we just see sort of the overall performance of the system, you know, actually increasing in a pretty steady clip', \" But there's no one thing\", \" There's actually like thousands of little things and just like polishing functionality and making sure that it handles, you know, every version and possible permutation of a situation by either applying more deep learning systems or just by, you know, adding more test coverage or new scenarios that we develop against and just grinding on that\", \" We're sort of in the unsexy phase of development right now, which is doing the real engineering work that it takes to go from prototype to production\", \" You're basically scaling the grinding, sort of taking seriously that the process of all those edge cases, both with human experts and machine learning methods to cover all those situations\", ' Yeah', \" And the exciting thing for me is I don't think that grinding ever stops because there's a moment in time where you've crossed that threshold of human performance and become superhuman\", \" But there's no reason, there's no first principles reason that AV capability will tap out anywhere near humans\", \" Like there's no reason it couldn't be 20 times better, whether that's, you know, just better driving or safer driving or more comfortable driving or even a thousand times better given enough time\", ' And we intend to basically chase that, you know, forever to build the best possible product', ' Better and better and better', ' And always new edge cases come up and new experiences', ' So, and you want to automate that process as much as possible', ' So what do you think in general in society? When do you think we may have hundreds of thousands of fully autonomous vehicles driving around? So first of all, predictions, nobody knows the future', \" You're a part of the leading people trying to define that future, but even then you still don't know\", ' But if you think about hundreds of thousands of vehicles, so a significant fraction of vehicles in major cities are autonomous', \" Do you think, are you with Rodney Brooks, who is 2050 and beyond, or are you more with Elon Musk, who is, we should have had that two years ago? Well, I mean, I'd love to have it two years ago, but we're not there yet\", \" So I guess the way I would think about that is let's flip that question around\", \" So what would prevent you to reach hundreds of thousands of vehicles? And that's a good, that's a good rephrasing\", ' Yeah', \" So the, I'd say the, it seems the consensus among the people developing self driving cars today is to sort of start with some form of an easier environment, whether it means, you know, lacking inclement weather or, you know, mostly sunny or whatever it is\", ' And then add, add capability for more complex situations over time', \" And so if you're only able to deploy in areas that meet sort of your criteria or the current domain, you know, operating domain of the software you developed, that may put a cap on how many cities you could deploy in\", ' But then as those restrictions start to fall away, like maybe you add capability to drive really well and safely in heavy rain or snow, you know, that, that probably opens up the market by two, two or three fold in terms of the cities you can expand into and so on', \" And so the real question is, you know, I know today if we wanted to, we could produce that, that many autonomous vehicles, but we wouldn't be able to make use of all of them yet\", ' Cause we would sort of saturate the demand in the cities in which we would want to operate initially', ' So if I were to guess like what the timeline is for those things falling away and reaching hundreds of thousands of vehicles, I would say that thousands of vehicles, maybe a range is better, I would say less than five years, less than five years', ' Yeah', \" And of course you're working hard to make that happen\", ' So you started two companies that were eventually acquired for each four billion dollars', \" So you're a pretty good person to ask, what does it take to build a successful startup? I think there's, there's sort of survivor bias here a little bit, but I can try to find some common threads for the things that worked for me, which is, you know, in, in both of these companies, I was really passionate about the core technology\", ' I actually like, you know, lay awake at night thinking about these problems and how to solve them', \" And I think that's helpful because when you start a business, there are like to this day, there are these crazy ups and downs\", \" Like one day you think the business is just on, you're just on top of the world and unstoppable\", \" And the next day you think, okay, this is all going to end, you know, it's just, it's just going south and it's going to be over tomorrow\", \" And and so I think like having a true passion that you can fall back on and knowing that you would be doing it, even if you weren't getting paid for it, helps you weather those, those tough times\", \" So that's one thing\", ' I think the other one is really good people', \" So I've always been surrounded by really good cofounders that are logical thinkers are always pushing their limits and have very high levels of integrity\", \" So that's Dan Kahn and my current company and actually his brother and a couple other guys for Justin TV and Twitch\", \" And then I think the last thing is just I guess persistence or perseverance, like, and, and that, that can apply to sticking to sort of, or having conviction around the original premise of your idea and sticking around to do all the, you know, the unsexy work to actually make it come to fruition, including dealing with, you know, whatever it is that you, that you're not passionate about, whether that's finance or, or HR or, or operations or those things, as long as you are grinding away and working towards, you know, that North star for your business, whatever it is, and you don't give up and you're making progress every day, it seems like eventually you'll end up in a good place\", ' And the only things that can slow you down are, you know, running out of money or I suppose your competitors destroying you', \" But I think most of the time it's, it's people giving up or, or somehow destroying things themselves rather than being beaten by their competition or running out of money\", ' Yeah', \" If you never quit, eventually you'll arrive\", \" So, uh, it's a much more concise version of what I was trying to say\", ' Yeah, that was good', ' So you went the Y Combinator route twice', ' Yeah', ' What do you think in a quick question, do you think is the best way to raise funds in the early days or not just funds, but just community develop your idea and so on', \" Can you do it solo or maybe with a co founder with like self funded?

There's no one size fits all answer, but if your ambition I think is to, you know, see how big you can make something or, or, or rapidly expand and capture a market or solve a problem or whatever it is, then, then, you know, going to venture back route is probably a good approach so that, so that capital doesn't become your primary constraint\", \" Y Combinator I love because it puts you in this, uh, sort of competitive environment where you're, where you're surrounded by, you know, the top, maybe 1% of other really highly motivated, you know, peers who are in the same, same place and that, uh, that environment I think just breeds breed success, right?

What elements of philosophy do you think you bring to your work in computer science? So it's surprisingly relevant\", \" So the part of the reason that I didn't do a computer science undergraduate degree was that there wasn't one at Stanford at the time, but that there's a part of philosophy and in fact, Stanford has a special submajor in something called now symbolic systems, which is logic, model theory, formal semantics of natural language\", \" And so that's actually a perfect preparation for work in AI and computer science\", \" That's kind of interesting\", \" So if you were interested in artificial intelligence, what kind of majors were people even thinking about taking? What is it in your science? So besides philosophies, what were you supposed to do if you were fascinated by the idea of creating intelligence?

Yeah, okay', ' So I showed up at SRI and we were building a brand new robot', ' As I said, none of the people from the previous project were kind of there or involved anymore', ' So we were kind of starting from scratch and my advisor was Stan Rosenstein', ' He ended up being my thesis advisor and he was motivated by this idea of situated computation or situated automata', ' And the idea was that the tools of logical reasoning were important, but possibly only for the engineers or designers to use in the analysis of a system, but not necessarily to be manipulated in the head of the system itself', \" So I might use logic to prove a theorem about the behavior of my robot, even if the robot's not using logic in its head to prove theorems\", ' So that was kind of the distinction', ' And so the idea was to kind of use those principles to make a robot do stuff', ' But a lot of the basic things we had to kind of learn for ourselves because I had zero background in robotics', \" I didn't know anything about control\", \" I didn't know anything about sensors\", ' So we reinvented a lot of wheels on the way to getting that robot to do stuff', \" Do you think that was an advantage or a hindrance? Oh no, I mean, I'm big in favor of wheel reinvention actually\", ' I mean, I think you learn a lot by doing it', \" It's important though to eventually have the pointers to, so that you can see what's really going on\", \" But I think you can appreciate much better the good solutions once you've messed around a little bit on your own and found a bad one\", ' Yeah', ' I think you mentioned reinventing reinforcement learning and referring to rewards as pleasures, pleasure', ' Yeah', ' Or I think, which I think is a nice name for it', ' Yeah', \" It's more fun almost\", \" Do you think you could tell the history of AI machine learning reinforcement learning and how you think about it from the fifties to now? One thing is that it's oscillates, right? So things become fashionable and then they go out and then something else becomes cool and that goes out and so on\", \" And I think there's, so there's some interesting sociological process that actually drives a lot of what's going on\", \" Early days was kind of cybernetics and control, right? And the idea that of homeostasis, right? People have made these robots that could, I don't know, try to plug into the wall when they needed power and then come loose and roll around and do stuff\", ' And then I think over time, the thought, well, that was inspiring, but people said, no, no, no, we want to get maybe closer to what feels like real intelligence or human intelligence', ' And then maybe the expert systems people tried to do that, but maybe a little too superficially, right? So, oh, we get the surface understanding of what intelligence is like, because I understand how a steel mill works and I can try to explain it to you and you can write it down in logic and then we can make a computer and for that', \" And then that didn't work out\", \" But what's interesting, I think, is when a thing starts to not be working very well, it's not only do we change methods, we change problems, right? So it's not like we have better ways of doing the problem of the expert systems people were trying to do\", ' We have no ways of trying to do that problem', ' Oh, yeah, no, I think maybe a few, but we kind of give up on that problem and we switched to a different problem and we worked that for a while and we make progress', ' As a broad community', ' As a community, yeah', \" And there's a lot of people who would argue, you don't give up on the problem, it's just you decrease the number of people working on it\", \" You almost kind of like put it on the shelf, say, we'll come back to this 20 years later\", \" Yeah, I think that's right\", \" Or you might decide that it's malformed\", \" Like you might say, it's wrong to just try to make something that does superficial symbolic reasoning behave like a doctor\", \" You can't do that until you've had the sensory motor experience of being a doctor or something\", \" So there's arguments that say that that problem was not well formed\", \" Or it could be that it is well formed, but we just weren't approaching it well\", ' So you mentioned that your favorite part of logic and symbolic systems is that they give short names for large sets', ' So there is some use to this', ' They use symbolic reasoning', ' So looking at expert systems and symbolic computing, what do you think are the roadblocks that were hit in the 80s and 90s? Ah, okay', ' So right', \" So the fact that I'm not a fan of expert systems doesn't mean that I'm not a fan of some kinds of symbolic reasoning, right? So let's see, roadblocks\", ' Well, the main road block, I think, was that the idea that humans could articulate their knowledge effectively into some kind of logical statements', \" So it's not just the cost, the effort, but really just the capability of doing it\", ' Right', \" Because we're all experts in vision, right? But totally don't have introspective access into how we do that\", ' Right', \" And it's true that, I mean, I think the idea was, well, of course, even people then would know, of course, I wouldn't ask you to please write down the rules that you use for recognizing a water bottle\", \" That's crazy\", ' And everyone understood that', \" But we might ask you to please write down the rules you use for deciding, I don't know, what tie to put on or how to set up a microphone or something like that\", \" But even those things, I think people maybe, I think what they found, I'm not sure about this, but I think what they found was that the so called experts could give explanations that sort of post hoc explanations for how and why they did things, but they weren't necessarily very good\", \" And then they depended on maybe some kinds of perceptual things, which again, they couldn't really define very well\", ' So I think fundamentally, I think the underlying problem with that was the assumption that people could articulate how and why they make their decisions', ' Right', \" So it's almost encoding the knowledge from converting from expert to something that a machine could understand and reason with\", ' No, no, no, no, not even just encoding, but getting it out of you', ' Right', ' Not, not, not writing it', \" I mean, yes, hard also to write it down for the computer, but I don't think that people can produce it\", \" You can tell me a story about why you do stuff, but I'm not so sure that's the why\", ' Great', ' So there are still on the hierarchical planning side, places where symbolic reasoning is very useful', \" So as you've talked about, so where's the gap? Yeah\", ' Okay, good', \" So saying that humans can't provide a description of their reasoning processes\", \" That's okay\", ' Fine', \" But that doesn't mean that it's not good to do reasoning of various styles inside a computer\", ' Those are just two orthogonal points', ' So then the question is what kind of reasoning should you do inside a computer? Right', ' And the answer is, I think you need to do all different kinds of reasoning inside a computer, depending on what kinds of problems you face', \" I guess the question is what kind of things can you encode symbolically so you can reason about? I think the idea about, and even symbolic, I don't even like that terminology because I don't know what it means technically and formally\", ' I do believe in abstractions', \" So abstractions are critical, right? You cannot reason at completely fine grain about everything in your life, right? You can't make a plan at the level of images and torques for getting a PhD\", \" So you have to reduce the size of the state space and you have to reduce the horizon if you're going to reason about getting a PhD or even buying the ingredients to make dinner\", ' And so how can you reduce the spaces and the horizon of the reasoning you have to do? And the answer is abstraction, spatial abstraction, temporal abstraction', ' I think abstraction along the lines of goals is also interesting, like you might, well, abstraction and decomposition', ' Goals is maybe more of a decomposition thing', \" So I think that's where these kinds of, if you want to call it symbolic or discrete models come in\", ' You talk about a room of your house instead of your pose', ' You talk about doing something during the afternoon instead of at 2', '54', ' And you do that because it and you do that because it makes your reasoning problem easier', \" And also because you have, you don't have enough information to reason in high fidelity about your pose of your elbow at 2\", '35 this afternoon anyway', ' Right', \" When you're trying to get a PhD\", \" Or when you're doing anything really\", ' Yeah', ' Okay', ' Except for at that moment, at that moment, you do have to reason about the pose of your elbow, maybe, but then you, maybe you do that in some continuous joint space kind of model', \" And so again, I, my biggest point about all of this is that there should be the dogma is not the thing, right? We shouldn't, it shouldn't be that I'm in favor against symbolic reasoning and you're in favor against neural networks\", ' It should be that just, just computer science tells us what the right answer to all these questions is', ' If we were smart enough to figure it out', ' Well, yeah', ' When you try to actually solve the problem with computers, the right answer comes out', ' But you mentioned abstractions', \" I mean, neural networks form abstractions or rather there's, there's automated ways to form abstractions and there's expert driven ways to form abstractions and expert human driven ways\", ' And humans just seem to be way better at forming abstractions currently and certain problems', \" So when you're referring to 2\", '45 PM versus afternoon, how do we construct that taxonomy? Is there any room for automated construction of such abstractions? Oh, I think eventually, yeah', \" I mean, I think when we get to be better and machine learning engineers, we'll build algorithms that build awesome abstractions\", \" That are useful in this kind of way that you're describing\", ' Yeah', \" So let's then step from the, the abstraction discussion and let's talk about POMM MDPs\", ' Partially observable Markov decision processes', ' So uncertainty', \" So first, what are Markov decision processes? What are Markov decision processes? And maybe how much of our world can be models and MDPs? How much, when you wake up in the morning and you're making breakfast, how do you, do you think of yourself as an MDP? So how do you think about MDPs and how they relate to our world? Well, so there's a stance question, right? So a stance is a position that I take with respect to a problem\", ' So I, as a researcher or a person who designs systems, can decide to make a model of the world around me in some terms', \" So I take this messy world and I say, I'm going to treat it as if it were a problem of this formal kind, and then I can apply solution concepts or algorithms or whatever to solve that formal thing, right? So of course the world is not anything\", \" It's not an MDP or a POMM DP\", \" I don't know what it is, but I can model aspects of it in some way or some other way\", ' And when I model some aspect of it in a certain way, that gives me some set of algorithms I can use', ' You can model the world in all kinds of ways', ' Some have, some are, some are, some are more accepting of uncertainty, more easily modeling uncertainty of the world', ' Some really force the world to be deterministic', ' And so certainly MDPs model the uncertainty of the world', ' Yes', ' Model some uncertainty', ' They model not present state uncertainty, but they model uncertainty in the way the future will unfold', ' Right', ' So what are Markov decision processes? So Markov decision process is a model', \" It's a kind of a model that you could make that says, I know completely the current state of my system\", ' And what it means to be a state is that I, that all the, I have all the information right now that will let me make predictions about the future as well as I can', \" So that remembering anything about my history wouldn't make my predictions any better\", ' And, but then it also says that then I can take some actions that might change the state of the world', \" And that I don't have a deterministic model of those changes\", ' I have a probabilistic model of how the world might change', \" It's a, it's a useful model for some kinds of systems\", \" I think it's a, I mean, it's certainly not a good model for most problems, I think, because for most problems you don't actually know the state\", \" For most problems you, it's partially observed\", \" So that's now a different problem class\", ' So, okay', \" That's where the POMDPs, the part that we observe with the Markov decision processes step in\", \" So how do they address the fact that you can't observe most incomplete information about most of the world around you? Right\", ' So now the idea is we still kind of postulate that there exists a state', \" We think that there is some information about the world out there such that if we knew that we could make good predictions, but we don't know the state\", ' And so then we have to think about how, but we do get observations', ' Maybe I get images or I hear things or I feel things, and those might be local or noisy', \" And so therefore they don't tell me everything about what's going on\", \" And then I have to reason about given the history of actions I've taken and observations I've gotten, what do I think is going on in the world? And then given my own kind of uncertainty about what's going on in the world, I can decide what actions to take\", ' And so how difficult is this problem of planning under uncertainty in your view and your long experience of modeling the world, trying to deal with this uncertainty in especially in real world systems? Optimal planning for even discrete POMDPs can be undecidable depending on how you set it up', \" And so lots of people say, I don't use POMDPs because they are intractable\", \" And I think that that's kind of a very funny thing to say because the problem you have to solve is the problem you have to solve\", \" So if the problem you have to solve is intractable, that's what makes us AI people, right? So we solve, we understand that the problem we're solving is wildly intractable that we can't, we will never be able to solve it optimally, at least I don't\", ' Yeah, right', ' So later we can come back to an idea about bounded optimality and something', \" But anyway, we can't come up with optimal solutions to these problems\", ' So we have to make approximations, approximations in modeling, approximations in the solution algorithms and so on', \" And so I don't have a problem with saying, yeah, my problem actually, it is POMDP in continuous space with continuous observations\", \" And it's so computationally complex, I can't even think about it's, you know, big O whatever\", \" But that doesn't prevent me from, it helps me, gives me some clarity to think about it that way and to then take steps to make approximation after approximation to get down to something that's like computable in some reasonable time\", ' When you think about optimality, the community broadly has shifted on that, I think a little bit in how much they value the idea of optimality, of chasing an optimal solution', \" How has your views of chasing an optimal solution changed over the years when you work with robots? That's interesting\", ' I think we have a little bit of a methodological crisis actually from the theoretical side', \" I mean, I do think that theory is important and that right now we're not doing much of it\", \" So there's lots of empirical hacking around and training this and doing that and reporting numbers, but is it good? Is it bad? We don't know\", \" It's very hard to say things\", ' And if you look at like computer science theory, so people talked for a while, everyone was about solving problems optimally or completely', ' And then there were interesting relaxations', \" So people look at, oh, are there regret bounds or can I do some kind of approximation? Can I prove something that I can approximately solve this problem or that I get closer to the solution as I spend more time and so on? What's interesting I think is that we don't have good approximate solution concepts for very difficult problems\", \" I like to say that I'm interested in doing a very bad job of very big problems\", ' Right', ' So very bad job, very big problems', ' I like to do that, but I wish I could say something', \" I wish I had a, I don't know, some kind of a formal solution concept that I could use to say, oh, this algorithm actually, it gives me something\", \" Like I know what I'm going to get\", ' I can do something other than just run it and get out', ' So that, that notion is still somewhere deeply compelling to you', ' The notion that you can say, you can drop thing on the table says this, you can expect this, this algorithm will give me some good results', \" I hope there's, I hope science will, I mean, there's engineering and there's science\", \" I think that they're not exactly the same\", \" And I think right now we're making huge engineering, like leaps and bounds\", ' So the engineering is running away ahead of the science, which is cool', \" And often how it goes, right? So we're making things and nobody knows how and why they work roughly, but we need to turn that into science\", \" There's some form\", \" It's a, yeah, there's some room for formalizing\", ' We need to know what the principles are', \" Why does this work? Why does that not work? I mean, for a while, people built bridges by trying, but now we can often predict whether it's going to work or not without building it\", ' Can we do that for learning systems or for robots? So your hope is from a materialistic perspective that intelligence, artificial intelligence systems, robots are just fancier bridges', ' Belief space', \" What's the difference between belief space and state space? So you mentioned MDPs, FOMDPs, reasoning about, you sense the world, there's a state\", \" Uh, what, what's this belief space idea? That sounds so good\", ' It sounds good', \" So belief space, that is instead of thinking about what's the state of the world and trying to control that as a robot, I think about what is the space of beliefs that I could have about the world\", \" What's, if I think of a belief as a probability distribution of our ways the world could be, a belief state is a distribution\", \" And then my control problem, if I'm reasoning about how to move through a world I'm uncertain about, my control problem is actually the problem of controlling my beliefs\", \" So I think about taking actions, not just what effect they'll have on the world outside, but what effect they'll have on my own understanding of the world outside\", ' And so that might compel me to ask a question or look somewhere to gather information, which may not really change the world state, but it changes my own belief about the world', \" That's a powerful way to, to empower the agent, to reason about the world, to explore the world\", \" So what kind of problems does it allow you to solve to, to consider belief space versus just state space? Well, any problem that requires deliberate information gathering, right? So if in some problems like chess, there's no uncertainty, or maybe there's uncertainty about the opponent, there's no uncertainty about the state\", \" And some problems, there's uncertainty, but you gather information as you go, right? You might say, Oh, I'm driving my autonomous car down the road and it doesn't know perfectly where it is, but the light hours are all going all the time\", \" So I don't have to think about whether to gather information\", \" But if you're a human driving down the road, you sometimes look over your shoulder to see what's going on behind you in the lane\", ' And you have to decide whether you should do that now', \" And you have to trade off the fact that you're not seeing in front of you and you're looking behind you and how valuable is that information and so on\", ' And so to make choices about information gathering, you have to reasonably space', ' Also, I mean, also to just take into account your own uncertainty before trying to do things', \" So you might say, if I understand where I'm standing relative to the door jam, pretty accurately, then it's okay for me to go through the door\", \" But if I'm really not sure where the door is, then it might be better to not do that right now\", \" The degree of your uncertainty about the world is actually part of the thing you're trying to optimize in forming the plan, right? So this idea of a long horizon of planning for a PhD or just even how to get out of the house or how to make breakfast\", \" You show this presentation of the WTF, where's the fork of robot looking at a sink\", \" And can you describe how we plan in this world of this idea of hierarchical planning we've mentioned? So yeah, how can a robot hope to plan about something with such a long horizon where the goal is quite far away?

So maybe you have to get out of the house, I have to get in the car, I have to drive and so on', ' And so you can plan if you can build abstractions', ' So this we started out by talking about abstractions', \" And we're back to that now, if you can build abstractions in your state space, and abstractions sort of temporal abstractions, then you can make plans at a high level\", \" And you can say, I'm going to go to town and then I'll have to get gas and then I can go here and I can do this other thing\", ' And you can reason about the dependencies and constraints among these actions, again, without thinking about the complete details', \" What we do in our hierarchical planning work is then say, all right, I make a plan at a high level of abstraction, I have to have some reason to think that it's feasible without working it out in complete detail\", \" And that's actually the interesting step\", ' I always like to talk about walking through an airport, like you can plan to go to New York and arrive at the airport, and then find yourself an office building later', \" You can't even tell me in advance what your plan is for walking through the airport, partly because you're too lazy to think about it, maybe, but partly also because you just don't have the information, you don't know what gate you're landing in, or what people are going to be in front of you or anything\", \" So there's no point in planning in detail, but you have to have, you have to make a leap of faith that you can figure it out once you get there\", \" And it's really interesting to me how you arrive at that\", ' How do you, so you have learned over your lifetime to be able to make some kinds of predictions about how hard it is to achieve some kinds of sub goals', \" And that's critical\", \" Like you would never plan to fly somewhere if you couldn't, didn't have a model of how hard it was to do some of the intermediate steps\", \" So one of the things we're thinking about now is how do you do this kind of very aggressive generalization to situations that you haven't been in and so on to predict how long will it take to walk through the Kuala Lumpur airport\", \" Like you could give me an estimate and it wouldn't be crazy\", \" And you have to have an estimate of that in order to make plans that involve walking through the Kuala Lumpur airport, even if you don't need to know it in detail\", \" So I'm really interested in these kinds of abstract models and how do we acquire them\", ' But once we have them, we can use them to do hierarchical reasoning, which is, I think is very important', ' Yeah', \" There's this notion of goal regression and preimage backchaining, this idea of starting at the goal and just forming these big clouds of states\", \" I mean, it's almost like saying to the airport, you know, once you show up to the airport that you're like a few steps away from the goal\", \" So like thinking of it this way, it's kind of interesting\", \" I don't know if you have sort of further comments on that of starting at the goal\", ' Yeah', \" I mean, it's interesting that Simon, Herb Simon back in the early days of AI talked a lot about means ends reasoning and reasoning back from the goal\", \" There's a kind of an intuition that people have that the number of that state space is big\", ' The number of actions you could take is really big', \" So if you say, here I sit and I want to search forward from where I am, what are all the things I could do?

If you were to try to maybe put another way, try to formulate human life as a planning problem', ' Well, that would be a mistake', \" I mean, it's not all a planning problem, right? I think it's really, really important that we understand that you have to put together pieces and parts that have different styles of reasoning and representation and learning\", \" I think it seems probably clear to anybody that it can't all be this or all be that\", \" Brains aren't all like this or all like that, right?

It's a very strong bias and it's a very critical bias\", ' So my own view is that we should look for more things that are like convolution, but the address other aspects of reasoning, right? So convolution helps us a lot with a certain kind of spatial reasoning', \" That's quite close to the imaging\", \" I think there's other ideas like that\", ' Maybe some amount of forward search, maybe some notions of abstraction, maybe the notion that objects exist', \" Actually, I think that's pretty important\", \" And a lot of people won't give you that to start with\", ' Right? So almost like a convolution in the, uh, uh, in the object, semantic object space or some kind of, some kind of ideas in there', \" That's right\", ' And people are starting like the graph, graph convolutions are an idea that are related to relation, relational representations', \" And so, so I think there are, so you, I've come I've come far field from perception, but I think, um, I think the thing that's going to make perception that kind of the next step is actually understanding better what it should produce\", \" Right?

I mean, that you need to have some part of the system that can observe other parts of the system and tell whether they're working well or not\", ' That seems critical', \" So does that count as, I mean, does that count as self awareness or not? Well, it depends on whether you think that there's somebody at home who can articulate whether they're self aware\", \" But clearly, if I have like, you know, some piece of code that's counting how many times this procedure gets executed, that's a kind of self awareness, right?

Well, to me, I guess the thing that seems most compelling to me at the moment is this question of what to build in and what to learn\", \" Um, I think we're, we don't, we're missing a bunch of ideas and, and we, you know, people, you know, don't you dare ask me how many years it's going to be until that happens because I won't even participate in the conversation because I think we're missing ideas and I don't know how long it's going to take to find them\", \" So I won't ask you how many years, but, uh, maybe I'll ask you what it, when you'll be sufficiently impressed that we've achieved it\", \" So what's, what's a good test of intelligence? Do you like the Turing test, the natural language in the robotic space? Is there something where you would sit back and think, Oh, that's, that's pretty impressive\", ' Uh, as a test, as a benchmark, do you think about these kinds of problems? No, I resist', ' I mean, I think all the time that we spend arguing about those kinds of things could be better spent just making the robots work better', \" Uh, so you don't value competition\", \" So, I mean, there's a nature of benchmark benchmarks and datasets or Turing test challenges where everybody kind of gets together and tries to build a better robot cause they want to out compete each other\", ' Like the DARPA challenge with the autonomous vehicles', ' Do you see the value of that or it can get in the way? I think it can get in the way', ' I mean, some people, many people find it motivating', \" And so that's good\", ' I find it anti motivating personally', ' Uh, but I think what, I mean, I think you get an interesting cycle where for a contest, a bunch of smart people get super motivated and they hack their brains out and much of what gets done is just hacks, but sometimes really cool ideas emerge', ' And then that gives us something to chew on after that', \" So I'm, it's not a thing for me, but I don't, I don't regret that other people do it\", ' Yeah', \" It's like you said with everything else that it makes us good\", ' So jumping topics a little bit, you started the journal of machine learning research and served as its editor in chief', ' Uh, how did the publication come about and what do you think about the current publishing model space in machine learning artificial intelligence? Okay, good', \" So it came about because there was a journal called machine learning, which still exists, which was owned by Cluer and there was, I was on the editorial board and we used to have these meetings annually where we would complain to Cluer that it was too expensive for the libraries and that people couldn't publish\", ' And we would really like to have some kind of relief on those fronts and they would always sympathize, but not do anything', ' So, uh, we just decided to make a new journal and, uh, there was the journal of AI research, which has, was on the same model, which had been in existence for maybe five years or so, and it was going on pretty well', ' So, uh, we just made a new journal', \" It wasn't, I mean, um, I don't know, I guess it was work, but it wasn't that hard\", ' So basically the editorial board, probably 75% of the editorial board of, uh, machine learning resigned and we founded the new journal, but it was sort of, it was more open', ' Yeah', ' Right', \" So it's completely open\", \" It's open access\", ' Actually, uh, uh, I had a postdoc, George Conidaris who wanted to call these journals free for all, uh, because there were, I mean, it both has no page charges and has no, uh, uh, access restrictions', ' And the reason, and so lots of people, I mean, there were, there were people who were mad about the existence of this journal who thought it was a fraud or something', ' It would be impossible', \" They said to run a journal like this with basically, I mean, for a long time, I didn't even have a bank account\", ' Uh, I paid for the lawyer to incorporate and the IP address and it just did cost a couple of hundred dollars a year to run', \" It's a little bit more now, but not that much more, but that's because I think computer scientists are competent and autonomous in a way that many scientists and other fields aren't\", ' I mean, at doing these kinds of things, we already types out our own papers', ' We all have students and people who can hack a website together in an afternoon', \" So the infrastructure for us was like, not a problem, but for other people in other fields, it's a harder thing to do\", ' Yeah', ' And this kind of open access journal is nevertheless one of the most prestigious journals', \" So it's not like, uh, prestige and it can be achieved without any of the\", '', '', ' Paper is not required for prestige', ' Yeah', ' It turns out', ' Yeah', \" So on the review process side of actually a long time ago, I don't remember when I reviewed a paper where you were also a reviewer\", ' And I remember reading your review being influenced by it and it was really well written', ' It influenced how I write feature reviews', ' Uh, you disagreed with me actually', ' Uh, and you made it, uh, my review, but much better', ' So, but nevertheless, the review process, you know, has its, uh, flaws', ' And how do you think, what do you think works well? How can it be improved? So actually when I started JMLR, I wanted to do something completely different', \" And I didn't because it felt like we needed a traditional journal of record\", ' And so we just made JMLR be almost like a normal journal, except for the open access parts of it, basically', ' Um, increasingly of course, publication is not even a sensible word', ' You can publish something by putting it in an archive so I can publish everything tomorrow', \" So making stuff public is, there's no barrier\", ' We still need curation and evaluation', \" I don't have time to read all of archive\", ' And you could argue that kind of social thumbs upping of articles suffices, right? You might say, Oh, heck with this', \" We don't need journals at all\", \" We'll put everything on archive and people will upvote and downvote the articles\", ' And then your CV will say, Oh man, he got a lot upvotes', \" So, uh, that's good\", \" Um, but I think there's still value in careful reading and commentary of things\", \" And it's hard to tell when people are upvoting and downvoting or arguing about your paper on Twitter and Reddit, whether they know what they're talking about, right? So then I have the second order problem of trying to decide whose opinions I should value and such\", \" So I don't know what I w if I had infinite time, which I don't, and I'm not going to do this because I really want to make robots work\", ' But if I felt inclined to do something more in the publication direction, I would do this other thing, which I thought about doing the first time, which is to get together some set of people whose opinions I value and who are pretty articulate', ' And I guess we would be public, although we could be private', \" I'm not sure\", ' And we would review papers', \" We wouldn't publish them and you wouldn't submit them\", ' We would just find papers and we would write reviews and we would make those reviews public', \" And maybe if you, you know, so we're Leslie's friends who review papers and maybe eventually if, if we, our opinion was sufficiently valued, like the opinion of JMLR is valued, then you'd say on your CV that Leslie's friends gave my paper a five star rating\", ' And that would be just as good as saying, I got it, so, you know, accepted into this journal', \" So I think, I think we should have good public commentary and organize it in some way, but I don't really know how to do it\", \" It's interesting times\", ' The way you describe it actually is really interesting', ' I mean, we do it for movies, imdb', 'com', \" There's experts, critics come in, they write reviews, but there's also regular non critics, humans write reviews and they're separated\", ' I like open review', ' The iClear process I think is interesting', \" It's a step in the right direction, but it's still not as compelling as reviewing movies or video games\", ' I mean, it sometimes almost, it might be silly, at least from my perspective to say, but it boils down to the user interface, how fun and easy it is to actually perform the reviews, how efficient, how much you as a reviewer get street cred for being a good reviewer', ' Those elements, those human elements come into play', \" No, it's a big investment to do a good review of a paper and the flood of papers is out of control\", ' Right', \" So, you know, there aren't 3000 new, I don't know how many new movies are there in a year\", \" I don't know, but that's probably going to be less than how many machine learning papers are in a year now\", \" And I'm worried, you know, I, right\", \" So I'm like an old person\", \" So of course, I'm going to say, things are moving too fast\", \" I'm a stick in the mud\", \" So I can say that, but my particular flavor of that is I think the horizon for researchers has gotten very short, that students want to publish a lot of papers and there's a huge, there's value\", \" It's exciting\", \" And there's value in that and you get patted on the head for it and so on\", \" But, and some of that is fine, but I'm worried that we're driving out people who would spend two years thinking about something\", ' Back in my day, when we worked on our thesis, we did not publish papers', ' You did your thesis for years', ' You picked a hard problem and then you worked and chewed on it and did stuff and wasted time and for a long time', ' And when it was roughly, when it was done, you would write papers', \" And so I don't know how to, and I don't think that everybody has to work in that mode, but I think there's some problems that are hard enough that it's important to have a long research horizon\", \" And I'm worried that we don't incentivize that at all at this point\", ' In this current structure', ' Yeah', ' So what do you see as, what are your hopes and fears about the future of AI and continuing on this theme? So AI has gone through a few winters, ups and downs', \" Do you see another winter of AI coming? Are you more hopeful about making robots work, as you said? I think the cycles are inevitable, but I think each time we get higher, right? I mean, so, you know, it's like climbing some kind of landscape with a noisy optimizer\", \" So it's clear that the, you know, the deep learning stuff has made deep and important improvements\", ' And so the high water mark is now higher', \" There's no question\", \" But of course, I think people are overselling and eventually investors, I guess, and other people will look around and say, well, you're not quite delivering on this grand claim and that wild hypothesis\", \" It's probably, it's going to crash some amount and then it's okay\", \" I mean, but I don't, I can't imagine that there's like some awesome monotonic improvement from here to human level AI\", ' So in, you know, I have to ask this question, I probably anticipate answers, the answers, but do you have a worry short term or long term about the existential threats of AI and maybe short term, less existential, but more robots taking away jobs? Well, actually, let me talk a little bit about utility', ' Actually, I had an interesting conversation with some military ethicists who wanted to talk to me about autonomous weapons', \" And they're, they were interesting, smart, well educated guys who didn't know too much about AI or machine learning\", \" And the first question they asked me was, has your robot ever done something you didn't expect? And I like burst out laughing because anybody who's ever done something on the robot right knows that they don't do it\", ' And what I realized was that their model of how we program a robot was completely wrong', ' Their model of how we can program a robot was like Lego mind storms, like, Oh, go forward a meter, turn left, take a picture, do this, do that', \" And so if you have that model of programming, then it's true\", \" It's kind of weird that your robot would do something that you didn't anticipate\", ' But the fact is, and actually, so now this is my new educational mission', \" If I have to talk to non experts, I try to teach them the idea that we don't operate, we operate at least one or maybe many levels of abstraction about that\", \" And we say, Oh, here's a hypothesis class, maybe it's a space of plans, or maybe it's a space of classifiers or whatever\", \" But there's some set of answers and an objective function\", ' And then we work on some optimization method that tries to optimize a solution solution in that class', \" And we don't know what solution is going to come out\", ' Right', \" So I think it's important to communicate that\", ' So I mean, of course, probably people who listen to this, they, they know that lesson', \" But I think it's really critical to communicate that lesson\", ' And then lots of people are now talking about, you know, the value alignment problem', ' So you want to be sure as robots or software systems get more competent, that their objectives are aligned with your objectives, or that our objectives are compatible in some way, or we have a good way of mediating when they have different objectives', \" And so I think it is important to start thinking in terms like, you don't have to be freaked out by the robot apocalypse, to accept that it's important to think about objective functions of value alignment\", ' Yes', \" And that you have to really everyone who's done optimization knows that you have to be careful what you wish for that, you know, sometimes you get the optimal solution, and you realize, man, that was that objective was wrong\", ' So pragmatically, in the shortest term, it seems to me that that that those are really interesting and critical questions', \" And the idea that we're going to go from being people who engineer algorithms to being people who engineer objective functions\", \" I think that's, that's definitely going to happen\", \" And that's going to change our thinking and methodology\", \" And so we're gonna you started at Stanford philosophy, that's where she could be\", ' And I will go back to philosophy maybe', \" Well, I mean, they're mixed together, because because, as we also know, as machine learning people, right? When you design, in fact, this is the lecture I gave in class today, when you design an objective function, you have to wear both hats, there's the hat that says, what do I want? And there's the hat that says, but I know what my optimizer can do to some degree\", ' And I have to take that into account', \" So it's it's always a trade off, and we have to kind of be mindful of that\", \" The part about taking people's jobs, I understand that that's important\", \" I don't understand sociology or economics or people very well\", \" So I don't know how to think about that\", \" So that's Yeah, so there might be a sociological aspect there, the economic aspect that's very difficult to think about\", ' Okay', ' I mean, I think other people should be thinking about it', \" But I'm just that's not my strength\", \" So what do you think is the most exciting area of research in the short term, for the community and for your for yourself? Well, so I mean, there's the story I've been telling about how to engineer intelligent robots\", \" So that's what we want to do\", ' We all kind of want to do well, I mean, some set of us want to do this', \" And the question is, what's the most effective strategy? And we've tried it\", \" And there's a bunch of different things you could do at the extremes, right? One super extreme is, what's the most effective strategy? And there's a bunch of different things you could do at the extremes, right? One super extreme is, we do introspection, and we write a program\", ' Okay, that has not worked out very well', ' Another extreme is we take a giant bunch of neural goo, and we try and train it up to do something', \" I don't think that's going to work either\", \" So the question is, what's the middle ground? And, and again, this isn't a theological question or anything like that\", \" It's just like, what's the middle ground? And I think it's clear, it's a combination of learning, to me, it's clear, it's a combination of learning and not learning\", \" And what should that combination be? And what's the stuff we build in? So to me, that's the most compelling question\", \" And when you say engineer robots, you mean engineering systems that work in the real world? Is that, that's the emphasis? Okay\", ' Last question', ' Which robots or robot is your favorite from science fiction? So you can go with Star Wars or RTD2, or you can go with more modern, maybe Hal from', '', '', \" I don't think I have a favorite robot from science fiction\", ' This is, this is back to, you like to make robots work in the real world here, not, not in', '', '', ' I mean, I love the process and I care more about the process', ' The engineering process', ' Yeah', \" I mean, I do research because it's fun, not because I care about what we produce\", \" Well, that's a, that's a beautiful note actually\", ' And Leslie, thank you so much for talking today', ' Sure', \" It's been fun\", '']\n"
